#
# CI lockfile — fails the build if any of the old red/blue team identifiers
# are reintroduced after the teamA/teamB rename. Wired into
# `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a step before `Lint` so the gate runs on
# every PR and push.
#
# Forbidden token regex copied verbatim from AC-001 of the spec
# `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-team-us-them-and-cross-seat-layout.md`.
# Do NOT edit the regex without renegotiating the frozen-after-approval
# spec section.
#
# Scope: client/src, server/internal, server/migrations. Excludes .git,
# node_modules, _bmad-output, dist, __snapshots__ (snapshots regenerate
# automatically; not the regression target).
#
# Local verification: deliberately add `// team_red` to any TS file under
# client/src and rerun — exit code must be 1, with the offending line
# printed.

# Pattern verbatim from AC-001 of the spec. Captures: teamRed/teamBlue
# (kebab + snake variants), TeamRed/TeamBlue, red*Points / blue*Points
# combinations, redScore/blueScore, redHandTotal/blueHandTotal,
# team_red_score / team_blue_score, --color-team-red/blue,
# text-team-red/blue, border-team-red/blue, bg-team-red/blue.
#
# Cleanup-pass extension (2026-05-01): also catch the prose-context
# "Red"/"Blue" team-naming patterns reintroduced in comments and assertion
# messages (the originals say `Red team`, `seat N (Red)`, `team red`, etc.).
# Tailwind suit colors and the Serbian word "red" (turn/order) are
# unaffected because they don't match these phrases.
#
# Compound-name tightening (2026-05-01): the prior pass kept bare `a`/`b`
# in compound identifiers (`a_card_points`, `aHandTotal`, `ACardPoints`,
# `aScore`, etc.). Winston's grep-ability rule requires the `team_`/`team`/
# `Team` prefix on compound names too — append those bare forms to the
# forbidden set so they can't be reintroduced. Word boundaries (\b) keep
# unrelated names that happen to start with `a` / `b` clear.
