// legalCards returns the set of cards that the player at the given seat is
// legally allowed to play, given the current game state. Implements Bitola
// variant card play validation:
//
//  1. Follow suit if possible — must overplay the highest led-suit card
//     currently in the trick when the player has a higher led-suit card
//     (applies whether the led suit is trump or not). Otherwise any
//     same-suit card is legal.
//  2. If void in led suit and the player holds at least one trump → must
//     cut. Over-trump the highest trump on the table if possible; otherwise
//     any trump is legal. Non-trumps are illegal in this branch — Bitola has
//     no partner-winning exemption.
//  3. If void in led suit and the player holds no trump → any card is legal.
