/**
 * Single source of truth for timed UI behaviour. Values are milliseconds.
 *

 * `CARD_THROW` should land in one place — not in five components. Names
 * describe the user-visible event, not the implementation.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *  • Most names map 1:1 to a single setTimeout / animation / transition.
 *  • `*_REDUCED` siblings exist where prefers-reduced-motion mandates a
 *    different (typically much shorter) value.
 *  • Tailwind `duration-XXX` classes that already encode these values are
 *    flagged in the comment so we don't drift.
