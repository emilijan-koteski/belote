### Information Density Validation

**Anti-Pattern Violations:**

**Conversational Filler:** 0 occurrences

**Wordy Phrases:** 0 occurrences

**Redundant Phrases:** 0 occurrences

**Total Violations:** 0

**Severity Assessment:** Pass

**Recommendation:** PRD demonstrates good information density with minimal violations. Consistent use of "Players can..." and "The system [verb]..." patterns throughout all functional requirements.

### Product Brief Coverage

**Product Brief:** `product-brief-beljot-2026-02-21.md`

#### Coverage Map

**Vision Statement:** Fully Covered — PRD Executive Summary directly mirrors and expands the brief vision.

**Target Users:** Fully Covered — All 3 brief personas (Ana, Marko, Ivan) are represented in User Journeys. Darko (room owner) is a valuable addition not in the brief.

**Problem Statement:** Fully Covered — Embedded in "What Makes This Special" section with specific competitor callouts.

**Key Features:** Partially Covered — see gaps below.

**Goals/Objectives:** Fully Covered — All phase targets and KPI table present and consistent with brief.

**Differentiators:** Fully Covered — "What Makes This Special" covers all five differentiators from brief.

#### Coverage Gaps

**Moderate Gaps (2):**

1. **Croatian Variant MVP Scope Divergence** — Product Brief MVP section includes "Croatian variant and Bitola variant (selectable per room)" as core v1 features. PRD Phase 1 MVP explicitly defers Croatian variant to Phase 2. This is a deliberate scope reduction that occurred during PRD creation but is not acknowledged in the PRD. Downstream readers (architect, devs) may be confused by the discrepancy without context.

2. **Group Queuing Not Captured** — Brief states: "2, 3, or 4 friends can queue together; remaining slots filled by matchmaking." This capability is absent from the PRD Functional Requirements. FR19 only covers single-player Quick Play queue entry. Group queuing is a distinct feature with meaningful implementation complexity and should be an explicit FR if in scope, or explicitly deferred if not.

#### Internal PRD Contradictions Discovered During Coverage Check

1. **Ana Journey vs. Phase 1 Scope (501 Mode)** — Journey 1 (Ana) is designated as a Phase 1 validation journey and explicitly uses 501-point mode. However, the Phase 1 MVP scope defers 501-point mode to Phase 2. A Phase 1 user journey must not rely on Phase 2 features.

2. **Darko Journey vs. Phase 1 Scope (Croatian Variant)** — Journey 4 (Darko) is designated as a Phase 1 validation journey and explicitly uses Croatian variant. Croatian variant is deferred to Phase 2. Same issue — Phase 1 journey relies on a Phase 2 feature.

**Informational (FR Phase Attribution):**

1. **Phase-Unqualified FRs for Out-of-Scope Features** — FR3 (social login), FR6 (friend requests), FR32 (emotes), FR47–FR52 (public profiles, spectator mode, achievements, cosmetics, tournaments, mobile) are all listed as unqualified functional requirements. The brief marks all of these as out of MVP scope. The PRD's Product Scope section assigns them to later phases, but the FR section provides no phase labels, making it difficult for downstream artifacts to know which FRs to implement now vs. later.

#### Coverage Summary

**Overall Coverage:** ~95% — Strong alignment on vision, users, goals, and most features.

**Critical Gaps:** 0

**Moderate Gaps:** 2 (Croatian variant scope divergence; group queuing not captured)

**Internal Contradictions:** 2 (Phase 1 journeys referencing Phase 2 features)

**Informational Gaps:** 1 (FR phase attribution missing)

**Recommendation:** PRD provides good coverage of Product Brief content. Address the two moderate gaps and two Phase 1/Phase 2 journey contradictions before using this PRD to drive architecture and development.

### Measurability Validation

#### Functional Requirements

**Total FRs Analyzed:** 52

**Format Violations:** 0 — All FRs use "[Actor] can [capability]" or "The system [verb]" patterns correctly.

**Subjective Adjectives Found:** 0

**Vague Quantifiers / Untestable Language:** 4

1. **FR28** — "applies appropriate XP/ELO outcomes" — "appropriate" is undefined and untestable. The FR does not specify what the outcomes are; the details live only in journey narrative (Journey 5). An FR must be self-contained and testable without reading narrative context.

2. **FR38** — "scaled ELO penalties... with penalty scaling by game progress" — the scaling formula (×0.5 early → ×2.0 late) appears only in the Product Brief and journey narrative, not in this FR. Without specific scale values, this FR cannot be implemented or tested consistently.

3. **FR39** — "Players can view a seasonal leaderboard of top-ranked players" — "top-ranked players" is a vague quantifier. How many players appear on the leaderboard? The absence of a count makes this untestable.

4. **FR43** — "Remaining players in an abandoned casual match receive partial XP based on game progress" — "partial XP" has no formula or range. What percentage of XP is awarded at 25% game progress vs. 90%? This is untestable as written.

**Implementation Leakage:** 0

**FR Violations Total:** 4

#### Non-Functional Requirements

**Total NFRs Analyzed:** 13

**Missing Metrics:** 1

1. **NFR (Security — Authentication sessions):** "Authentication sessions must use time-limited tokens with secure refresh mechanisms" — no time limit specified. How long until a session token expires? Without a metric this cannot be implemented consistently or tested.

**Vague Conditions (Undefined Test Context):** 2

1. **NFR (Performance — Initial page load):** "within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection" — "standard broadband" is undefined. What connection speed qualifies? (e.g., 25 Mbps? Lighthouse simulated throttling?) Without a defined test condition this cannot be reproduced.

2. **NFR (Performance — 500ms sync):** "within 500ms under normal network conditions" — "normal network conditions" is undefined. Same issue; the test condition is not reproducible without a baseline definition.

**Untestable Constraint (Architecture Directive):** 1

1. **NFR (Scalability — Horizontal scaling):** "The platform architecture must permit horizontal scaling to accommodate growth beyond Phase 2 without a full rebuild" — this is an architectural design constraint, not a measurable NFR. It cannot be empirically verified; it requires an architecture review. Should be rewritten as a design constraint or removed from the NFR section.

**Missing Measurement Methods (Informational):** All 5 Performance NFRs specify specific numeric targets (±1s, 200ms, 500ms, 3s, 1s) but none specify a measurement method (e.g., "as measured by Playwright E2E tests" or "as measured by APM instrumentation"). Per BMAD NFR standards the full template includes a measurement method. The metrics are present; auditability is incomplete.

**NFR Violations Total:** 4

#### Overall Assessment

**Total Requirements:** 65 (52 FRs + 13 NFRs)

**Total Violations:** 8

**Severity:** Warning (5–10 violations)

**Recommendation:** Most requirements are well-formed and testable. Address FR28, FR38, FR39, FR43 to make XP/ELO outcomes and partial XP unambiguous. Fix the session token duration and page load/sync test condition gaps in NFRs. Rewrite the horizontal scaling entry as an architecture constraint rather than an NFR. Adding measurement methods to the Performance NFRs would bring full BMAD template compliance.

### Traceability Validation

#### Chain Validation

**Executive Summary → Success Criteria:** Intact — Vision (three user types, competitive ecosystem, both variants) maps cleanly to all three success dimensions (User, Business, Technical) and the measurable outcomes table.

**Success Criteria → User Journeys:** Intact — All five user-facing success criteria (rule correctness, first-game time, casual room creation in 2 min, competitive rank progression, diaspora cross-region reliability) have direct supporting journeys.

**User Journeys → Functional Requirements:** Intact — All capability items listed in the Journey Requirements Summary table map to specific FRs. No journey capability is left without a supporting FR.

**Scope → FR Alignment:** Misaligned — The FR list includes all four phases of the product without phase labels. Features explicitly deferred from Phase 1 (Croatian variant, ELO/ranked system, XP/levels, 501 mode, social login, friend system, emotes, spectator mode, achievements, cosmetics, tournaments, mobile) appear as phase-unlabeled FRs. This makes it impossible to determine which FRs are in Phase 1 scope by reading the FR section alone.

#### Orphan Elements

**Orphan Functional Requirements:** 11 — FRs with no supporting user journey (all are future-phase roadmap features; no MVP-critical FRs are orphaned):

- FR3 (social login) — Phase 3, no journey
- FR5 (player search by username) — Phase 3, no journey
- FR6 (friend requests) — Phase 3, no journey
- FR32 (in-game emotes) — Phase 4, no journey
- FR45 (additional languages) — Phase 3, no journey
- FR47 (public player profiles) — Phase 3+, no journey
- FR48 (spectator/observer mode) — Phase 4, no journey
- FR49 (achievements and badges) — Phase 4, no journey
- FR50 (cosmetic purchases) — Phase 4, no journey
- FR51 (bracket tournaments) — Phase 4, no journey
- FR52 (mobile experience) — Phase 3, no journey

**Note:** All orphan FRs are intentional roadmap entries. The user journeys intentionally cover Phase 1 scenarios only. This is a structural consequence of mixing all-phase FRs in a single unlabeled section.

**Unsupported Success Criteria:** 0

**User Journeys Without Supporting FRs:** 0

#### Traceability Matrix

| Journey             | Key Capabilities                                             | Supporting FRs                                                    | Status                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Ana (Casual)        | Registration, lobby, Bitola rules, pause, scoring, chat      | FR1, FR2, FR7, FR9–FR12, FR14/15, FR16–18, FR20, FR22, FR24, FR31 | Intact                |
| Marko (Competitive) | XP, levels, ranked, ELO, placement, leaderboard              | FR33–FR40                                                         | Intact                |
| Ivan (Diaspora)     | Room search, Bitola reshuffle, match history, stats          | FR7, FR17, FR18, FR41, FR42                                       | Intact                |
| Darko (Room Owner)  | Create room, config, lobby mgmt, game start, pause override  | FR16, FR17, FR20, FR21, FR22                                      | Intact                |
| Edge Cases          | Disconnect, reconnect, ELO penalty, partial XP, auto-play    | FR25–FR28, FR38, FR43                                             | Intact                |
| Future Roadmap      | Social login, friends, emotes, spectator, achievements, etc. | FR3, FR5, FR6, FR32, FR45, FR47–FR52                              | Orphaned (no journey) |

**Total Traceability Issues:** 1 structural (Scope → FR phase labeling gap) + 11 orphan FRs (all expected roadmap entries, no MVP-critical orphans)

**Severity:** Warning — No MVP-critical orphans or broken chains; structural phase-labeling gap is the primary actionable finding.

**Recommendation:** The traceability chain from vision through journeys to FRs is sound for all Phase 1 content. Add phase labels (e.g., `[Phase 2]`, `[Phase 3]`) to each FR that falls outside Phase 1 scope. This is the single most impactful structural improvement available and would also resolve the FR phase attribution finding from the Brief Coverage check.

### Implementation Leakage Validation

#### Leakage by Category

**Frontend Frameworks:** 0 violations

**Backend Frameworks:** 0 violations

**Databases:** 0 violations

**Cloud Platforms:** 0 violations

**Infrastructure:** 0 violations

**Libraries:** 0 violations

**Other Implementation Details:** 0 violations

**Notes on borderline terms (all assessed as acceptable):**

- **HTTPS / WSS** (NFR Security) — Capability-relevant: specifies encrypted communication requirement, not a technology vendor or library choice.
- **"server-side"** (NFR Security) — Capability-relevant: defines a security constraint that client cannot influence game outcomes. Appropriate for a security NFR.
- **"cryptographic hash"** (NFR Security) — Borderline but acceptable: a security NFR specifying a constraint on password storage method is standard practice at the requirements level.
- **SPA / client-side routing / WebSocket** (Web Application Requirements section) — Architecture language is present in that section, but the Web Application Requirements section is a project-type requirements section by design. This is appropriate placement; it is not in the FR or NFR sections.

#### Summary

**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** 0

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** No significant implementation leakage found. FRs and NFRs properly specify WHAT the system must do without prescribing HOW to build it. Protocol and architecture references are all capability-relevant or appropriately scoped to the project-type requirements section.

### Domain Compliance Validation

**Domain:** `gaming_entertainment`
**Complexity:** Low — Gaming domain carries no regulatory compliance requirements (no HIPAA, PCI-DSS, WCAG/508, or FedRAMP mandates apply).
**Assessment:** N/A — No special domain compliance sections required for this project type.

**Note:** This PRD is for a consumer gaming platform without regulated data categories. Standard security and data privacy practices (covered in NFRs) are sufficient.

### Project-Type Compliance Validation

**Project Type:** `web_app`

#### Required Sections

**Browser Matrix:** Present ✓ — "Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (latest 2 major versions)" specified in Web Application Requirements.

**Responsive Design:** Present ✓ — Explicitly addressed as intentional exclusion: "Desktop only: No responsive/mobile layout required for MVP." Deliberate scope decision, documented appropriately.

**Performance Targets:** Present ✓ — NFR Performance section contains 5 specific numeric targets (timer sync ±1s, state render 200ms, card play sync 500ms, initial load 3s, WebSocket reconnect 1s).

**SEO Strategy:** Present ✓ — Explicitly addressed as intentional exclusion: "No SEO requirements." Appropriate for a private authenticated gaming platform.

**Accessibility Level:** Present ✓ — Explicitly addressed as intentional exclusion: "No accessibility compliance targets for MVP." Noted and documented.

#### Excluded Sections (Should Not Be Present)

**Native Features:** Absent ✓

**CLI Commands:** Absent ✓

#### Compliance Summary

**Required Sections:** 5/5 present (all addressed, exclusions documented deliberately)

**Excluded Sections Present:** 0 violations

**Compliance Score:** 100%

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** Full project-type compliance for `web_app`. All required sections are present or explicitly scoped out with documented rationale. No excluded sections present. The pattern of explicitly stating "No SEO requirements" and "No accessibility compliance targets" is good PRD practice — it confirms deliberate decisions rather than silent omissions.

### SMART Requirements Validation

**Total Functional Requirements:** 52

#### Scoring Summary

**All scores ≥ 3:** 73% (38/52)
**All scores ≥ 4:** 73% (38/52)
**Overall Average Score:** ~4.2/5.0

**Methodology note:** 38 non-flagged FRs scored 4–5 on all five criteria and are not individually listed. The table below covers only the 14 flagged FRs.

#### Flagged FRs (Score < 3 in One or More Categories)

| FR                          | S   | M   | A   | R   | T   | Avg | Flag Reason                                |
| --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| FR3 (Social login)          | 4   | 4   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 3.4 | T: no supporting journey (Phase 3 orphan)  |

**Legend:** S=Specific, M=Measurable, A=Attainable, R=Relevant, T=Traceable. 1=Poor, 3=Acceptable, 5=Excellent. Flag = score < 3 in any category.

#### Improvement Suggestions for Flagged FRs

**FR28:** Replace "appropriate XP/ELO outcomes" with explicit outcomes per case: "…the system awards no XP to the abandoning player, preserves the ELO of remaining players (match voided), and applies a scaled ELO penalty to the abandoning player per FR38."

**FR38:** Add the scaling definition: "…with the multiplier ranging from ×0.5 at game start to ×2.0 at game completion, applied proportionally to game progress at time of abandonment."

**FR43:** Add the partial XP formula: e.g. "…receiving XP equal to [game progress %] × [full match XP value]."

**FR3, FR5, FR6, FR32, FR45, FR47–FR52 (Orphan roadmap FRs):** Add phase labels (e.g. `[Phase 3]`) to each and note traceability to the Product Scope roadmap section. Consider adding lightweight future-phase journey sketches to anchor these FRs, or explicitly document them as roadmap entries rather than active requirements.

#### SMART Overall Assessment

**Severity:** Warning — 26.9% flagged (14/52). Threshold for Warning is 10–30%.

**Recommendation:** Core Phase 1 FRs (38/52) are high quality and well-formed. The 14 flagged FRs break into two clean categories: 3 measurability gaps (FR28, FR38, FR43) that require specific formula additions, and 11 traceability orphans that are all intentional roadmap entries needing phase labels. Addressing these two categories fully resolves all FR quality concerns.

### Holistic Quality Assessment

#### Document Flow and Coherence

**Assessment:** Good

**Strengths:**

- Opening narrative is immediately compelling — establishes the gap, the community, and the solution with specificity ("Bela!" in Ana's journey; café tournament backstory for Marko). Unusual for a PRD to feel this real.
- Vision → Scope → Journeys → Requirements narrative arc is logically coherent and well-paced.
- Risk Mitigation section is rare and valuable — demonstrates product thinking beyond requirements.
- Journey Requirements Summary table is an excellent structural bridge between narrative and technical sections.
- FR formatting is consistent throughout (52 FRs, consistent verb patterns, grouped by domain).
- User journeys are concrete enough to inspire design decisions without prescribing them.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- The Phase 1 journey/scope contradictions (Ana using 501 mode, Darko using Croatian variant) undermine trust in the document's internal consistency — the most damaging flow issue.
- Project Classification section interrupts the executive narrative flow; could be absorbed into frontmatter.
- The FR section reads as a full roadmap list rather than a phase-structured capability contract, weakening the MVP story when read in isolation.

#### Dual Audience Effectiveness

**For Humans:**

- Executive-friendly: Strong — "What Makes This Special" delivers a crisp differentiation statement. Phase milestones are clear business checkpoints.
- Developer clarity: Good — FR format is clean and actionable. Journey-to-FR summary table is developer-friendly. Phase labels missing from FR section is the main gap.
- Designer clarity: Very strong — User journeys are detailed enough to drive UX flows directly. Pause interaction, match chat, declaration announcement moments are all documented at the right fidelity.
- Stakeholder decision-making: Good — Phased scope with clear success criteria enables informed scope conversations.

**For LLMs:**

- Machine-readable structure: Very strong — Consistent `##` headers, `FR#` numbering, grouped by domain, table summaries.
- UX readiness: Good — Journeys + capability tables give a UX agent strong input for flow generation.
- Architecture readiness: Good — NFRs, WebSocket requirements, server-authoritative constraint, scalability tiers all provide clear architectural inputs. The Web Application Requirements section is particularly useful.
- Epic/Story readiness: Adequate — Phase 1 FRs are identifiable only by cross-referencing the Scope section with the FR list. An LLM agent working from FRs alone cannot distinguish Phase 1 from Phase 4. Adding phase labels would make this Excellent.

**Dual Audience Score:** 4/5

#### BMAD PRD Principles Compliance

| Principle           | Status  | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Density | Met     | 0 anti-pattern violations; consistent dense style throughout                     |
| Measurability       | Partial | 8 violations; 3 FRs and 4 NFRs need metric additions                             |
| Traceability        | Partial | Core Phase 1 chain intact; 11 orphan roadmap FRs; 2 journey/scope contradictions |
| Domain Awareness    | Met     | Gaming domain correctly identified; no compliance requirements applicable        |

| Markdown Format     | Met     | Consistent structure, proper header hierarchy, tables formatted correctly        |

**Principles Met:** 5/7 (Measurability and Traceability are Partial)

#### Overall Quality Rating

**Rating:** 4/5 — Good

This PRD is well above the bar. The domain specificity, narrative authenticity in user journeys, and comprehensive scope phasing are exemplary. It is a working document that can drive downstream artifacts today. The findings are refinements — not fundamental gaps.

#### Top 3 Improvements

1. **Add phase labels to all out-of-scope FRs in the FR section** — Annotate each FR that falls outside Phase 1 with its target phase (e.g., `[Phase 2]`, `[Phase 3]`). This single change eliminates the traceability orphan issue, resolves the FR phase attribution gap from Brief Coverage, resolves the Scope → FR Alignment misalignment from Traceability, and makes the FR section directly usable for Phase 1 development without cross-referencing the Scope section. Highest ROI improvement available.

2. **Fix the two Phase 1 journey/scope contradictions** — Ana's journey (Phase 1) uses 501 mode (Phase 2 feature); Darko's journey (Phase 1) uses Croatian variant (Phase 2 feature). Resolution options: (a) Update those journeys to use only Phase 1 features (Bitola + 1001), or (b) Move those journeys to Phase 2 and replace with Phase 1-only variants. These contradictions are the most trust-undermining finding — an architect or developer reading this would be uncertain which features to build first.

3. **Resolve the 3 measurability gaps in FRs 28, 38, and 43** — Add the ELO penalty scaling formula to FR38, inline the specific outcomes for each abandon case into FR28, and add a partial XP formula or tier table to FR43. These are fast additions (1–2 sentences each) that make critical game-economy mechanics testable and implementation-ready.

#### Holistic Summary

**This PRD is:** A high-quality, domain-specific, narratively compelling requirements document that is ready for downstream use with three targeted improvements.

**To make it great:** Fix the two journey/scope contradictions, add phase labels to all future-phase FRs, and specify the three missing game-economy formulas.

**User Journeys Coverage:** Complete — All 3 product brief personas (Ana/casual, Marko/competitive, Ivan/diaspora) are covered. Darko (room owner) and Edge Cases are bonus coverage.

**FRs Cover MVP Scope:** Yes — All Phase 1 MVP capabilities identified in the scope section have corresponding FRs. Quality note: FRs for Phase 2–4 features are present without phase labels.

**NFRs Have Specific Criteria:** All — Every NFR contains a specific numeric target or constraint. Measurement methods are absent on performance NFRs (quality gap, not completeness gap).

**Frontmatter Completeness:** 4/4

#### Completeness Summary

**Overall Completeness:** ~98% (6/6 core sections complete, 0 template variables, 4/4 frontmatter fields)

**Critical Gaps:** 0

**Minor Gaps:** 2 (already captured in prior validation steps — phase labels missing from FR section; 3 FRs with incomplete measurability)

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** PRD is structurally complete with all required sections populated and no template artifacts remaining. All gaps identified are quality refinements (measurability, phase labeling, journey consistency), not completeness failures.
