### Additional Requirements & Constraints

- **Architecture:** Server-authoritative — client is a thin renderer, no client-side game logic
- **Platform:** SPA, desktop-only, minimum viewport 1280x720
- **Phased delivery:** MVP = Phase 1 (Bitola only, no ranked, no social login, no 501); Phase 2 adds Croatian variant + competitive; Phase 3 adds mobile + social; Phase 4 is vision features
- **i18n:** Extensible language system from day one
- **Solo developer:** Aggressive MVP scoping to match resource reality

### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD is thorough and well-structured. All 53 FRs are clearly numbered and scoped. NFRs cover performance, security, scalability, and reliability with measurable targets. Phase boundaries are explicit — MVP scope is clearly delineated from future phases. The phased approach is sound for a solo developer.

- Coverage percentage: **100%**

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

Found: `ux-design-specification.md` — comprehensive 14-step spec built from the product brief and PRD.

### UX to PRD Alignment

- All 5 PRD user journeys (Ana, Marko, Ivan, Darko, Edge Cases) are fully represented in UX journey flows with matching capabilities
- UX platform strategy matches PRD: desktop SPA, 1280x720 minimum, evergreen browsers, WebSocket real-time
- UX phasing matches PRD: Phase 1 = Bitola only + casual play; Phase 2 = Croatian variant + ranked/competitive
- UX i18n scope matches PRD: English + Serbian (Latin) at launch, extensible
- All core interaction patterns (single-click card play, PICK/PASS bidding, DECLARE/SKIP declarations, score reveal, Capot animation) trace directly to PRD functional requirements
- Minor note: Ana's PRD journey references "501 mode" but FR15 (501 mode) is deferred from Phase 1. This is the PRD showing the full vision — not a contradiction, but implementation agents should follow the Phase 1 scope (1001 only)

### UX to Architecture Alignment

- Architecture specifies Tailwind + shadcn/ui + React Router v7 + Zustand + react-i18next — all adopted in UX spec
- Exact same Balatro design token set in both documents: background (#0a0a0f), surface (#13131a), accent (#00e5a0), team-red (#ff4d4d), team-blue (#4d9fff), etc.
- Typography system aligned: Space Grotesk (display/headings) + Inter (UI/body) — both documents specify same fonts and roles
- Architecture component list matches UX: PlayingCard, HandCards, TrickArea, TrumpPrompt, DeclarationPrompt, ScorePanel, TimerRing, ScoreReveal
- Seat mapping consistent: Architecture seats 0-3 CCW with 0+2=Red, 1+3=Blue matches UX compass layout (South=you, West, North=teammate, East)
- WebSocket single multiplexed connection with 4-prefix event convention (action:/event:/error:/system:) is reflected in UX interaction flows
- Server-authoritative principle maintained throughout UX — client renders server state, no client-side game logic
- Timer sync via absolute server timestamps (Architecture) matches UX TimerRing specification (within +/-1s of server time)
- Feature folder organization (auth/, game/, lobby/, profile/, chat/) aligns with UX screen groupings

### Warnings

- No significant alignment gaps found between UX, PRD, and Architecture
- All three documents were built sequentially (PRD first, UX from PRD, Architecture from PRD+UX) and cross-reference each other consistently
- The UX spec is well-positioned to guide frontend implementation without ambiguity

## Epic Quality Review

### Story Inventory

12 epics, 42 stories total across 4 phases:
- Phase 1 (Epics 1-7): 27 stories
- Phase 2 (Epics 8-9): 11 stories
- Phase 3 (Epic 10): 5 stories
- Phase 4 (Epics 11-12): 5 stories (6 with tournament story split)

### Epic User Value Validation

| Epic | Title | User Value? | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Project Foundation & Player Identity | Yes | Register, login, profile, language selection — clear user outcomes |
| 2 | Lobby & Room Management | Yes | Create, browse, join rooms, team pick, game start |
| 3 | Belot Rules Engine (Bitola Variant) | Borderline | Rules engine is server-side; user value is indirect (correctness). See Major Issues. |
| 4 | Real-Time Game Experience | Yes | Play a complete game, see scores, timers work |
| 5 | Game Session Resilience | Yes | Pause, disconnect recovery, graceful abandonment |
| 6 | In-Game & Lobby Communication | Yes | Chat in lobby and during matches |
| 7 | Match History & Player Profile | Yes | View past games, see career stats |
| 8 | Croatian Variant, 501 & Enhancements | Yes | New variant, shorter mode, surrender, emotes, rules reference |
| 9 | Player Progression & Competitive | Yes | XP, levels, ranked, ELO, seasons, leaderboard |
| 10 | Social & Friend System | Yes | Social login, friends, public profiles, languages |
| 11 | Spectator, Achievements & Cosmetics | Yes | Watch games, earn badges, buy skins |
| 12 | Tournaments & Mobile | Yes | Bracket events, mobile access |

### Epic Independence Validation

| Epic | Depends On | Forward Deps? | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | None | None | Independent |
| 2 | Epic 1 (auth) | None | Correct backward dep |
| 3 | None (pure functions) | None | Independent |
| 4 | Epic 2 (rooms), Epic 3 (rules) | None | Correct backward deps |
| 5 | Epic 4 (game sessions) | None | Correct backward dep |
| 6 | Epic 4 (WebSocket gateway) | None | Correct backward dep |
| 7 | Epic 4 (completed matches) | None | Correct backward dep |
| 8 | Epics 3-4 (rules + sessions) | None | Correct backward deps |
| 9 | Epic 4 (game sessions) | None | Correct backward dep |
| 10 | Epic 1 (auth) | None | Correct backward dep |
| 11 | Epics 4, 9 | None | Correct backward deps |
| 12 | Multiple earlier epics | None | Correct backward deps |

No forward dependencies found. All cross-epic dependencies point backward.

### Story Quality Assessment

**Acceptance Criteria Format:** All 42 stories use proper Given/When/Then BDD format with specific, testable outcomes. Error scenarios are covered systematically.

**Database Creation Timing:**
- `users` table: Created in Story 1.2 (when user registration is first needed)
- `rooms` table: Created in Story 2.1 (when room creation is first needed)
- `matches` table: Created in Story 4.2 (when match recording is first needed)
- Tables are created when first needed, not upfront in a setup story

**Starter Template:** Story 1.1 covers the full project scaffold per Architecture spec (Vite + React, Go + Echo, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Tailwind tokens, shadcn/ui, i18n setup, Makefile)

**Test Fixtures:** Architecture requires test fixture factory functions in `internal/game/testfixtures/`. Stories 3.1-3.6 each specify required fixtures. This is well-integrated.

### Findings by Severity

#### Major Issues

**1. Epic 3 is primarily a technical epic**
- "Belot Rules Engine (Bitola Variant)" frames the epic around building a software component, not delivering user value
- Story 3.1 uses "As a developer" framing; stories 3.2-3.6 use "As a player" but are only verifiable via unit tests, not through a UI
- **Mitigating factors:** This is the core game domain. The Architecture mandates the rules engine as pure functions (`ApplyAction(state, action) -> (state, error)`) that must be thoroughly tested before wiring to the UI. The split between engine (Epic 3) and real-time UI (Epic 4) is architecturally sound and pragmatically necessary for a solo developer.
- **Recommendation:** Acceptable as-is. Reframing as "Players can play Belot with correct Bitola rules" would overlap with Epic 4. The current structure enables independent testing of the rules engine — a critical quality gate for a card game where rule correctness is the #1 success criterion.

#### Minor Concerns

**1. Developer-facing story framing in Stories 1.1, 3.1, 4.1**
- These use "As a developer..." instead of "As a user..." framing
- Standard and acceptable for infrastructure stories in greenfield projects (scaffold, types definition, WebSocket gateway)

**2. Story 5.5 forward-references Epic 9**
- Match abandonment story notes "placeholder for Epic 9" regarding XP outcomes
- This is a deferred concern documented transparently, NOT a blocking dependency
- The story is fully completable without Epic 9 — it simply records abandonment data that Epic 9 will later use

**3. Story 7.2 references Epic 1 Story 1.4 placeholders**
- "placeholder sections were created in Epic 1 Story 1.4" — this is a backward reference to completed work, not a forward dependency. Correct pattern.

### Best Practices Compliance Summary

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Epics deliver user value | 11/12 clear, 1 borderline | Epic 3 is defensible for game domain |
| Epic independence (no forward deps) | Pass | All deps point backward |
| Story sizing | Pass | All stories are independently completable |
| No forward dependencies | Pass | One transparent deferred concern (5.5 re: Epic 9) |
| Database tables created when needed | Pass | users, rooms, matches — each created in the story that first requires them |
| Clear acceptance criteria | Pass | All 42 stories use Given/When/Then BDD format |
| FR traceability maintained | Pass | Every FR mapped to specific epic in coverage map |

### Overall Epic Quality Assessment

The epics are well-structured with strong adherence to best practices. The one borderline case (Epic 3 as a technical epic) is architecturally justified and poses no implementation risk. Story quality is consistently high across all 42 stories — comprehensive ACs, proper error handling, and clear traceability to requirements.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

**READY**

This project is ready for implementation. All four core documents (PRD, UX Design, Architecture, Epics & Stories) are complete, internally consistent, and well-aligned with each other. No critical blockers were found.

### Assessment Summary

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Document Inventory | All 4 required documents found, no duplicates |
| PRD Completeness | 53 FRs + 17 NFRs, clearly numbered and phased |
| FR Coverage | 100% — all 53 FRs mapped to epics |
| UX Alignment | Strong alignment across PRD, UX, and Architecture |
| Epic Quality | 11/12 epics clearly user-value-driven; 1 borderline but justified |
| Story Quality | 42 stories, all with BDD acceptance criteria, proper sizing |
| Dependencies | No forward dependencies; all cross-epic deps point backward |
| Database Timing | Tables created when first needed, not upfront |

### Issues Found

- 0 Critical violations
- 1 Major issue (Epic 3 technical framing — accepted with justification)
- 3 Minor concerns (developer-facing story framing, one deferred forward reference, one backward placeholder reference)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Proceed to Sprint Planning** — Run `bmad-sprint-planning` to generate the sprint execution plan from the epics. This produces the sprint-status.yaml that implementation agents will follow.

2. **Start with Epic 1** — The Phase 1 implementation path is clear: Epic 1 (Foundation) → Epic 2 (Lobby) → Epic 3 (Rules Engine) → Epic 4 (Real-Time Game) → Epic 5 (Resilience) → Epic 6 (Chat) → Epic 7 (Match History).

3. **Prioritize rules engine testing** — Epic 3 is the highest-risk component. The PRD identifies rule correctness as the #1 success criterion. Leverage the pure-function architecture and test fixture factories to achieve the Architecture's >90% coverage target for `internal/game/`.

### Optional Improvements (Not Required)

- Consider reframing Epic 3 title to be more user-centric (e.g., "Correct Bitola Belot Rules") — cosmetic, no functional impact
- The PRD notes that FR28, FR38, and FR43 have undefined formulas requiring product decisions before Phase 2 implementation — these do not affect Phase 1 readiness

### Final Note

This assessment identified 4 issues across 2 severity categories (1 major, 3 minor). None require action before proceeding to implementation. The planning artifacts are thorough, well-aligned, and ready to drive Phase 1 development.
