# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of spec-timer-auto-actions-and-dialog-rings (2026-05-02)

- **`cancelTurnTimer()` does not increment `timerGeneration`** — pre-existing paper-guard race in the pause/unpause path. When `ActionPause` runs while a per-move timer goroutine is already past `time.AfterFunc` and blocked on `session.mu.Lock()`, `cancelTurnTimer()` does not bump the generation counter, so the stale handler eventually acquires the lock with a passing staleness check. Today the `default` case in `handleTimerExpiry`'s switch silently returns, so no corruption occurs — but a future patch that adds work above the switch could fire spuriously after pause. Fix scope: increment `session.timerGeneration` inside `cancelTurnTimer()` (or in the pause branch) so the staleness guard catches this case explicitly. [server/internal/session/manager.go:861-919, ws-edge-case review 2026-05-02]

## Deferred from: code review of spec-quickplay-auto-seat-on-join (2026-04-29)

- **Auto-start broadcasts `system:game_started` even when `gameStarter.StartGame` failed** — clients navigate to `/game/{id}` for a game session that does not exist on the server. Pre-existing pattern duplicated from the `SelectSeat` auto-start branch (`server/internal/room/handler.go:670-731`). Fix scope: refactor both auto-start paths to gate the broadcast and the `playing` status flip on `StartGame` success. [server/internal/room/handler.go:1287-1298]
- **`pickFirstEmptySeat` returning `apperr.ErrRoomFull` is reachable on `player_count` counter drift** — the QuickPlay retry loop only retries on `ErrRoomCodeTaken`/`ErrRoomNameTaken`, so a 5-seat-occupied room caused by counter drift surfaces as an opaque 5xx instead of falling back to a different/new room. Pre-existing counter-drift gap (Story 2.5 review explicitly deferred this). [server/internal/room/handler.go:1126-1135]
- **`LeaveRoom` does not gate on `room.Status == "waiting"` under lock** — a leave can race the auto-start tx and `gameStarter.StartGame` runs with a `seatInfo` containing a player who has already left. Same race exists for the existing `SelectSeat` auto-start; this change adds a second exposure point. Fix scope: re-check `room.Status == "waiting"` in `LeaveRoom`'s tx, or serialize start/leave via an explicit lock. [server/internal/room/handler.go:443-542]

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-project-scaffold-and-development-environment (2026-04-10)

- **W1: fetchClient 401 handler doesn't implement refresh-then-retry cycle** — **RESOLVED in Story 1.3** — fetchClient now implements 401 → refresh → retry with `_isRetry` guard and concurrent refresh deduplication.
- **W2: apperr.Wrap wraps raw error instead of AppError** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `Wrap` now wraps the `appErr` (not raw `err`), so `errors.As` correctly matches the AppError after wrapping.
- **W3: ErrorBoundary "Try again" can loop on deterministic errors** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — "Try again" now calls `window.location.reload()` for a clean restart. Added `resetKey` prop for route-change auto-recovery.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-user-registration (2026-04-10)

- **D1: Token lost on page refresh** — **MITIGATED in Story 1.3** — No Zustand persist middleware, but `useAuthInit()` calls refresh endpoint on mount using httpOnly cookie. Session survives refresh with brief unauth flash. Design intent met.
- **D2: fetchClient hard redirect on 401 breaks SPA UX** — **RESOLVED in Story 1.3** — Uses `setAuthRedirect()` callback pattern with React Router `navigate("/login")` instead of `window.location.href`.
- **D3: Default JWT secret warning-only** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Config now calls `os.Exit(1)` in non-development environments when JWT secret is default.
- **D4: No rate limiting on registration endpoint** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Infrastructure-level concern. Address when adding API gateway or rate-limiting middleware.
- **D5: Refresh token Secure:true hardcoded** — **RESOLVED in Story 1.3** — `Secure: h.env != "development"` in `auth/handler.go` makes it environment-aware.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-user-login-and-session-persistence (2026-04-11)

- **D6: Logout fire-and-forget can orphan refresh cookie server-side** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — By-design fire-and-forget. Server-side revocation requires DB session store (Phase 2).
- **D7: Refresh tokens stateless with no server-side revocation** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Requires DB session store or token-version column. Planned for Phase 2.
- **D8: Same signing secret for access and refresh tokens** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Audience claim differentiates. Separate keys planned for Phase 2 defense-in-depth.
- **D9: Mutable `var` AppError sentinels shared across goroutines** — **ACCEPTED** — Go `var` pointer sentinels are idiomatic for `errors.Is` matching. No code path mutates them; enforced by code review convention. Changing to functions would break all `errors.Is` usage.
- **D10: `apperr.Wrap()` wraps raw error instead of AppError** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Same as W2; `Wrap` now wraps the AppError.
- **D11: Default JWT secret only warns, doesn't abort in production** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Same as D3; `os.Exit(1)` in non-development environments.
- **D12: No Unicode normalization on email addresses** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added `norm.NFC.String()` normalization in both login and registration email processing paths.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-4-basic-player-profile-and-navigation-shell (2026-04-11)

- **D13: Duplicate `getUserID` helper diverges from `auth.GetUserID`** — **ACCEPTED** — Import cycle (`auth` imports `user`) prevents `user` from importing `auth.GetUserID`. Duplication is intentional and idiomatic Go. Both implementations are identical.
- **D14: `i18n.language` region subtag comparison** — **ACCEPTED** — Project only configures `"en"` and `"sr"` as supported locales with no region subtags. Will only break if locale detection plugins are added.
- **D15: Path parameter `:id` accepts 0 as valid user ID** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Both `GetProfile` and `UpdatePreferences` now reject `paramID == 0` as `ErrBadRequest`.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-1-create-room-and-room-configuration (2026-04-11)

- **D16: FindByID returns (nil, nil) for missing rooms** — **ACCEPTED** — Established project pattern (FindByCode uses same convention). All callers check `room == nil` after nil-error return. Changing would break existing call sites.
- **D17: No rate limiting on room creation endpoint** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Infrastructure-level concern. Address when adding API gateway or rate-limiting middleware.
- **D18: No per-user active room count cap** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Business rule not specified. Address when product defines a limit.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-2-browse-and-search-rooms (2026-04-11)

- **D19: `handleWsMessage` uses unsafe `as` casts on raw `JSON.parse` output** — **RESOLVED in Story 4.1** — All `as` casts in `useWsDispatch.ts` are guarded by `if (type === CONSTANT)` discriminant checks.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-3-join-room-and-room-lobby (2026-04-11)

- **D20: WS events system:player_joined and system:player_left are TODO-only** — **RESOLVED in Story 4.7** — Server broadcasts both events in `room/handler.go`; client dispatches via `roomLobbyStore`.
- **D21: Copy Link copies room code, not a full URL** — **ACCEPTED** — Spec says "code/link"; current behavior matches intent for WhatsApp/Viber sharing.
- **D22: Orphan room_players rows for soft-deleted rooms** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — No functional impact. Cleanup script planned for Phase 2.
- **D23: No unit test for useRoomLobbyUpdates handler logic** — **RESOLVED** — `useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts` superseded by `roomLobbyStore` + `useWsDispatch`; tests exist in `roomLobbyStore.test.ts` and `useWsDispatch.test.ts`. Dead file deleted in mid-Phase 1 cleanup.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-4-team-assignment-and-game-start (2026-04-11)

- **D24: `useRoomLobbyUpdates` hardcodes `id: 0` for joined players** — **RESOLVED** — Fixed in active code (`useWsDispatch.ts` uses `id: payload.userId`). Dead file `useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts` deleted in mid-Phase 1 cleanup.
- **D25: `onRoomUpdated` uses unsafe `as unknown as Room` cast** — **RESOLVED** — Dead file `useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts` deleted in mid-Phase 1 cleanup. Active code uses proper `roomLobbyStore` dispatch.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-5-quick-play-matchmaking (2026-04-11)

- **D26: TOCTOU race on FindPlayerRoom check before transaction** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Pre-existing pattern. Mitigated by low scale; DB unique constraints catch concurrent duplicates.
- **D27: Only 4th-seat player receives gameStarted notification** — **RESOLVED in Story 4.7** — Server broadcasts `system:game_started` via WS to all room participants. HTTP response `gameStarted: true` also returned to all.
- **D28: Client abort does not cancel server-side room join/creation** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Server completes the operation; user recovers via ALREADY_IN_ROOM on retry.
- **D29: player_count denormalized counter drift risk** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Counter tracked via atomic increment/decrement in transactions. Drift risk is low at Phase 1 scale; refactor to subquery count in Phase 2 if drift observed.
- **D30: No TTL/cleanup for abandoned Quick Play rooms** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Lobby disconnect handler marks empty rooms as "completed". Background cleanup job for stale rooms planned for Phase 2.
- **D31: RoomLobby has no real-time refresh for other players' actions** — **RESOLVED in Story 4.7** — RoomLobby now uses `roomLobbyStore` with real-time WS dispatch for `player_joined`, `player_left`, `seat_updated`, `game_started` events.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-1-game-state-types-card-encoding-and-deck (2026-04-12)

- **D32: Duplicate playerID validation missing in `NewGame`** — **ACCEPTED** — Validation at boundary: session manager receives players from room handler which enforces unique DB users in seated positions. Pure game layer stays validation-free by design.
- **D33: Zero UserID (uint 0) accepted silently in `NewGame`** — **ACCEPTED** — Same as D32; GORM auto-increment guarantees DB IDs start at 1. Room handler validates players before session creation.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-2-trump-bidding-bitola-variant (2026-04-12)

- **D34: cloneGameState does not deep-copy pointer fields (TrumpCandidate, TrumpSuit, TrumpCallerSeat, etc.)** — After shallow struct copy, pointer fields like `*Card`, `*Suit`, `*int` are shared aliases between original and clone. Currently safe because code always assigns new pointers rather than writing through existing ones. Will become a real aliasing bug when play-phase handlers (Stories 3.3-3.6) are added if they write through pointer fields. Fix by deep-copying pointer fields in cloneGameState when adding card play logic. **RESOLVED in Story 3.3** — all 6 pointer fields now deep-copied.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-3-card-play-and-trick-resolution (2026-04-12)

- **D35: `legalCards` dereferences `TrumpSuit`/`LeadSuit` without nil guards** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added nil guard returning full hand if `TrumpSuit` or `LeadSuit` is nil.
- **D36: `currentTrickWinnerSeat` returns -1 for empty trick → `TeamForSeat(-1)` = -1 in Go** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `isOpponentWinning` now returns `false` for empty trick or nil TrumpSuit, preventing the -1 sentinel from reaching `TeamForSeat`.
- **D37: No bounds check on `action.PlayerSeat` before array index** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `handlePlayCard` now validates `action.PlayerSeat` is in range [0,3] before any array access.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-6-match-completion-and-special-conditions (2026-04-12)

- **D38: Nil TrickWinnerSeat dereference in `scoreHand()`** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added nil guard with early return in `scoreHand()` before dereferencing `TrickWinnerSeat`.

## Deferred from: nav bar user avatar addition (2026-04-12)

- **D39: AppLayout tests use `className` string-contains assertions for active tab styling** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Tests now use `toHaveAttribute("aria-current", "page")` instead of `className.toContain("border-accent")`.
- **D40: No `afterEach` store reset in AppLayout tests** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added `afterEach` that resets `useAuthStore` to initial state.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-3-game-table-ui-layout-seats-and-cards (2026-04-12)

- **D41: EVENT_CARD_PLAYED cardId[0]/[1] parsing assumes 2-char format** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added bounds check: `if (!payload.cardId || payload.cardId.length < 2) return;` before accessing indices.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-4-trump-bidding-and-declaration-ui (2026-04-12)

- **D42: `playableCardIds` includes ALL hand cards with no legal-move filtering** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Server rejects illegal plays with clear error toast. Adding server-side `legalMoves` to GameState is a Phase 2 UX enhancement.
- **D43: `PlayerState.username` missing from server Go `PlayerState` struct** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added `Username string` to `PlayerState`, `PlayerSeatInfo`, and `NewGame()`. Server now populates username from room player data.
- **D44: `TrumpSelectedPayload.trumpSuit` unsafe `as` cast from `string` to `Suit | null`** — **ACCEPTED** — Handler returns early without processing the payload; cast is unreachable. The full authoritative state follows via `event:game_state`.
- **D45: `window.confirm()` for back-button interception** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Standard browser API, works across platforms. Custom modal replacement planned for Phase 2 UX polish.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-5-per-move-timer-and-auto-play (2026-04-12)

- **D46: GetStateSnapshot returns mutable pointer** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Now returns a shallow copy (`snapshot := *session.gameState; return &snapshot`) so callers cannot observe concurrent mutations.
- **D47: legalCards dereferences TrumpSuit without nil check** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Same as D35; nil guard added.
- **D48: Client clock skew — no server-client time sync** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Spec accepts ±1s tolerance. Server-client time sync via `serverTimeMs` field planned for Phase 2.

## Deferred from: code review of 5-1-player-pause-system (2026-04-13)

- **D53: `sendGameError` routes ALL game errors as `error:invalid_action`** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `sendGameError` now uses `errors.Is` dispatch to map `apperr` sentinels to typed WS error events (`error:not_your_turn`, `error:wrong_phase`, `error:illegal_play`, `error:pause_exhausted`, `error:no_active_pause`, `error:not_room_owner`, `error:player_disconnected`).
- **D54: Disconnect while paused leaves game frozen** — **RESOLVED in Story 5.3** — `HandleDisconnect()` in `reconnect.go` auto-clears disconnected player's pause and resumes game if no other pauses remain.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-6-score-panel-score-reveal-and-match-flow (2026-04-13)

- **D49: LastHandResult not cleared in startNewHand()** — **ACCEPTED** — `LastHandResult` intentionally persists through `startNewHand()` so the session manager can broadcast it. Overwritten by the next `scoreHand()` call. Client ignores it outside score reveal flow.
- **D50: cloneGameState shallow-copies LastHandResult pointer** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `cloneGameState` now deep-copies `LastHandResult` pointer field.
- **D51: matchDurationSec includes session setup time** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Overstates actual play time by including lobby/deal/bidding. Acceptable approximation.
- **D52: Second hand_scored during reconnect while overlay active loses that hand's score reveal** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — Edge case only during reconnection. The overlay guard prevents UI glitches; the missed score data is cosmetic (match scores are correct). Overlay queue for Phase 2.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-7-room-lobby-websocket-wiring (2026-04-13)

- **D53: `userId` used as `RoomPlayer.id` field in WS dispatch** — **ACCEPTED** — DB row ID not available from WS event; `userId` serves as a unique client-side identifier. No API calls use this `id` field.
- **D54: Dead code `useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts` with known bugs** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — File deleted. Active code in `useWsDispatch.ts` + `roomLobbyStore` has no known bugs.
- **D55: `project-context.md` not updated for 5th Zustand store** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Updated to list 5 partitioned stores including `roomLobbyStore`.

## Deferred from: code review of 5-2-room-owner-pause-override (2026-04-13)

- **D56: Room ownership transfer during active game not synced to session** — **ACCEPTED for Phase 1** — OwnerSeat fixed at game start by design. Owner must be seated to start game, and leaving during game is not a normal flow.
- **D57: No integration test for broadcast `OwnerOverride: true`** — **ACCEPTED** — Low priority test gap. Broadcast code is straightforward and covered by manual testing.
- **D58: No WS-layer test for `error:not_room_owner` event delivery** — **ACCEPTED** — D53 fix enables proper dispatch. Integration test is low priority.

## Deferred from: code review of 5-3-disconnect-detection-and-reconnect-countdown (2026-04-13)

- **D59: `username` field in `PlayerDisconnectedPayload` is always empty** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `HandleDisconnect` now reads `gs.Players[seat].Username` (populated via D43 fix).
- **D60: `ERROR_PLAYER_DISCONNECTED` unreachable on wire** — **RESOLVED** — D53 fix dispatches `error:player_disconnected` via `errors.Is(err, apperr.ErrPlayerDisconnected)`.
- **D61: `startNewHand` does not reset disconnect fields** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — `startNewHand()` now resets `DisconnectedSeat = -1` and `ReconnectExpiresAt = nil`. `HandleReconnect()` also clears on reconnect.

## Deferred from: code review of 5-4-reconnection-and-state-restoration (2026-04-13)

- **D62: `handleReconnectTimeout` stub leaves game in PhaseDisconnected after window expires** — RESOLVED in Story 5.5: `handleReconnectTimeout` now fully implements match abandonment (transition to `PhaseMatchEnd`, persist match record, broadcast `event:match_abandoned`, remove session).

## Deferred from: code review of 5-5-match-abandonment-on-timeout (2026-04-14)

- **D63: Page refresh during/after abandonment shows blank game page** — **RESOLVED in mid-Phase 1 cleanup** — Added `useEffect` in `GamePage.tsx` that detects stale `match_end` phase with no overlay data and redirects to lobby.

## Deferred from: auth init bug fix (2026-04-14)

- **D64: `doRefresh()` in fetchClient does not pass AbortSignal to `refresh()`** — Pre-existing. The 401 retry path in `fetchClient` calls `refresh()` without an AbortSignal. Not related to StrictMode double-mount fix. Low risk at current scale.
- **D65: GORM logger uses `log.New` (plain text) while app uses `slog` (JSON)** — Pre-existing. GORM's default logger already output plain text before configuration change. Creating a proper slog adapter is a Phase 2 observability improvement.

## Deferred from: code review of fix-auth-routing-and-refresh (2026-04-16)

- **D66: Stale `gameState` in gameStore on re-login after session expiry** — Pre-existing. When 401 interceptor calls `authStore.logout()`, it clears token and user but does not reset `gameStore`. If the user logs in again, `useReconnectionRedirect` sees stale game state and may redirect to a game page for a game that has ended server-side. Low risk: server will reject actions on ended games.

## Deferred from: code review of declaration-reveal-cards-and-timing (2026-04-17)

- **D67: DeclarationReveal anchors panel to `declarations[0].playerSeat`** — If the server ever broadcasts declarations from two teammates on the winning team (e.g. seat 0 has a tierce and seat 2 has a different sequence), the panel anchors to the first entry only. Current spec and bitola dedup rules imply a single declarer wins the clash, so this is theoretical. Revisit if multi-teammate broadcasts become possible (e.g. Croatian variant where both teammates' declarations can survive).

## Deferred from: code review of belot-rebelot-prompt-and-reveal (2026-04-17)

- **D68: `prefersReducedMotion` snapshotted once via `useMemo`, not reactive** — `BelotReveal.tsx` and `DeclarationReveal.tsx` both read `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches` once at mount and never subscribe to the `change` event. If a user toggles the OS-level reduce-motion setting mid-session, subsequent reveals use the stale value until the next page load. Shared pattern — fix once by introducing a `useReducedMotion` hook that subscribes to media-query changes.
- **D69: Belot reveal lost on reconnect during the 4s window** — Server's `event:belot_announced` fires once on announcement. On reconnect, the server sends `event:game_state` (which carries `belotAnnounced: true`) but does not replay the cardId-bearing reveal event. A user refreshing during the 4s reveal window — or a late-joining spectator — never sees the overlay. Spec treats the reveal as purely visual so the gap is acceptable; revisit if spectators are added or if reveal persistence becomes important (would need `belotAnnouncedCardId` carried in `GameState`).

## Deferred from: code review of fix-declaration-reveal-broadcast-missing (2026-04-17)

- **D70: Tie-bias in declaration-winner derivation** — `manager.go`'s `broadcastDeclarationsResolvedIfTransition` (and the original inline block it replaced) reports the winner by `DeclarationPoints[Red] > 0 ? Red : (Blue > 0 ? Blue : null)`. If both teams somehow have declaration points simultaneously, Red wins silently. Pre-existing bias; the game-layer `resolveDeclarations` is supposed to zero the losing team, so this is defensive only. Revisit if game-layer invariants weaken.
- **D71: Stale `declarationReveal` surviving a mid-animation reconnect** — `useWsDispatch.ts` `setGameState` does not reset `declarationReveal`. If a client disconnects during the 4s reveal window and reconnects quickly, the store still holds the prior payload and the overlay re-renders on top of the reconnected game state. Low-severity UX edge. Fix by resetting reveal fields inside `setGameState` on reconnect, or by clearing them in the reconnect flow specifically.

## Deferred from: code review of 6-1-global-lobby-chat (2026-04-18)

- **D72: Server-side sanitization of chat text + username** — control characters, RTL overrides, and zero-width joiners are broadcast verbatim. JSX auto-escapes XSS, but malicious unicode can disrupt the chat list rendering. Phase 1 chat is intentionally unmoderated per Dev Notes; revisit when chat moderation lands in Phase 2. [server/internal/chat/handler.go:96-107]
- **D73: WS router dispatches actions via `go r.ActionHandler(...)` without per-client serialization** — two concurrent chat messages from the same client can be processed out of submission order, producing out-of-order timestamps. UI renders by append order. Pre-existing pattern affecting all action handlers; not introduced by Story 6.1. [server/internal/ws/router.go:19]
- **D74: Lobby right-column `min-h-150` (≈600px) forces page-level scroll on viewports below 600px tall** — breaks the nested chat auto-scroll because `scrollIntoView` scrolls the page instead of the chat list. UX spec targets 1280×720 minimum viewport, so out of scope; revisit if mobile/small-viewport support is added. [client/src/features/lobby/LobbyPage.tsx:169]
- **D75: `chat.handleGlobal` collapses transient DB error and "user deleted" into the same silent drop** — sender gets no feedback in either case, so a transient failure permanently loses the message with no retry. Asymmetric log payload (`error=<nil>` vs real error). Phase 1 chat has no retry/error UX surface; revisit alongside moderation work. [server/internal/chat/handler.go:96-100]
- **D76: `i18n.test.ts` does not assert key parity between `en.json` and `sr.json`** — `chat.*` keys are in parity manually but adding a key to one file but not the other would not fail any test. Pre-existing infrastructure gap not introduced by this story. [client/src/shared/i18n/i18n.test.ts]
- **D77: No end-to-end test covering sender's own-message echo through a real `*ws.Hub`** — handler tests use a hub spy; the real `*ws.Hub.BroadcastToUsers` path is exercised by `ws_test.go` but not in conjunction with the chat handler. Unit coverage is comprehensive (11 handler tests); integration test would duplicate `ws_test.go` machinery. [server/internal/chat/handler_test.go]

## Deferred from: code review of 6-2-match-scoped-chat (2026-04-18)

- **D78: Race between `session.Manager.MatchParticipants` and `Hub.BroadcastToUsers`** — Participants are read under `RLock` and released before broadcast. If `RemoveSession` runs between the read and the broadcast (e.g. match-end teardown racing with an in-flight match chat send), the broadcast fans out to player IDs whose session is already gone. Consequence is mild: a late match chat reaches players who just returned to the lobby, reseeding their (already cleared) `matchMessages`. Fix requires the session manager to own the broadcast atomically under the write lock — architectural change. Systemic concurrency concern shared with other session broadcasts; revisit alongside chat moderation work in Phase 2. [server/internal/chat/handler.go:130-178]
- **D79: No rate limiting on match chat** — a participant can flood the 3 other players' client queues at WS ingress rate. No per-user cooldown, token bucket, or flood check. Same pre-existing gap as D72 for global chat; Phase 1 chat is intentionally unmoderated. Revisit when chat moderation lands in Phase 2. [server/internal/chat/handler.go:130-178]
- **D80: `RFC3339Nano` server timestamps provide nanosecond precision but no monotonic ordering guarantee under NTP clock corrections** — messages sorted by timestamp may misorder on backward clock jumps. Systemic across all server-stamped events (timers, disconnects, declarations), not specific to chat. Fix would require a monotonic per-session sequence number carried alongside the timestamp. Project-wide concern not introduced by this story; out of scope. [server/internal/chat/handler.go:161]
- **D81: Concurrent `action:chat_message` goroutines per client can interleave** — same pre-existing router pattern that Story 6.1 deferred as D73. A sender's two rapid-fire messages may reach peers out of submission order. Fix would be a per-client serialization layer at the router. Router-level change out of scope for a chat story. [server/internal/ws/router.go:19]

## Deferred from: code review of 7-1-match-history-display (2026-04-19)

- **D82: Offset-based pagination duplicates / skips rows on concurrent match completions** — a new match completing between page 1 and page 2 shifts rows, causing the same `match.id` to appear on two pages → React duplicate-key warnings in `useInfiniteQuery`'s `flatMap`. Acceptable for Phase 1's low match-completion rate; revisit with cursor pagination `(completed_at, id)` or client-side dedupe by match id. Pre-existing offset-pagination pattern across the codebase. [client/src/shared/hooks/queries/useMatches.ts, server/internal/match/gorm_repo.go `GetMatchesForUser`]
- **D83: `openIds` Set accumulates entries for matches no longer in the visible list** — tiny memory retention, no functional break. Prune against current `items` on each render, or use `Map<number, boolean>` with pagination-aware pruning. Cosmetic micro-optimisation. [client/src/features/profile/MatchHistory.tsx:344]
- **D84: `Load more` button stays enabled during background refetch** — only `isFetchingNextPage` disables the button; a click while page 1 is refetching fires `fetchNextPage` against a stale `total`. Rare in practice (react-query `staleTime` guards). Also disable on `query.isFetching`. [client/src/features/profile/MatchHistory.tsx:413-425]
- **D85: `loadUsernamesForMatches` returns empty string for soft-deleted users** — row renders with `teammate=""` / empty opponent name instead of a "Deleted user" placeholder. UX polish only; no data leak. Revisit alongside Epic 11 public profiles. [server/internal/user/handler.go:249-273]
- **D86: `strconv.ParseUint(..., 10, 64)` cast to `uint` can truncate on 32-bit builds** — `uint(paramID)` drops high bits on 32-bit platforms; a foreign `:id = 4294967297` could equate to auth user `1` and bypass the 403 check. Mirrors the existing `GetProfile` pattern. Systemic fix: compare `uint64` to `uint64` everywhere, or enforce 64-bit build. Pre-existing. [server/internal/user/handler.go:181-185]

## Deferred from: code review of 7-2-expanded-player-profile (2026-04-19)

- **D87: No integration test exercises the real `FILTER … CASE` SQL** — `TestGetProfile_StatsMatchListTotal` asserts the `totalGamesPlayed == /matches.total` invariant at the mock level (`handler_test.go:82-116`), not against the Postgres Raw query in [gorm_repo.go:34-74](server/internal/match/gorm_repo.go#L34-L74). A typo or NULL-semantics mismatch in the real SQL would not fail any test. Requires a Postgres-backed repo test harness, which this project does not have today; pre-existing infrastructure gap.
- **D88: Stats / match-list status-filter desync risk** — both `GetStatsForUser` (FILTER clauses only cover `completed` + `abandoned`) and `GetMatchesForUser` (`WHERE status IN (completed, abandoned)`) independently hardcode the same two status values. If a future story introduces `in_progress` / `cancelled` / `forfeited` etc. and updates only one side, `totalGamesPlayed` silently drifts from the `/matches` list total, violating the AC #2 invariant. No current bug; future-proof flag. [server/internal/match/gorm_repo.go:46-62, :78]

## Deferred from: code review of spec-room-scoped-chat (2026-04-22)

- **D89: TOCTOU / two unsynchronised DB reads in `chatRoomMembership.RoomMembers`** — `FindByID` and `FindPlayersByRoomID` run outside a transaction, so `startGame` (or a concurrent leave/join) flipping state between the two reads produces a member list that doesn't reflect the authoritative room state at any single moment. Consequence is mild: a just-left player may receive one extra message; a just-joined player may miss one. Identical shape to the match-chat race deferred as D79. Fix would join `rooms.status = 'waiting'` into a single read or wrap both reads in `repo.RunInTransaction`. Systemic concurrency concern shared with other session broadcasts. [server/cmd/api/main.go:180-204]
- **D90: `ChatMessagePayload` has no `roomId` / `matchId` — client cannot verify scope identity** — the dispatcher's `currentRoomId !== null` guard prevents leaks into a cleared store but cannot distinguish "frame from room A" vs "frame from room B" when both are momentarily active. Server-authoritative recipient list protects today. Adding `roomId?` + `matchId?` to the payload lets the client drop foreign-origin frames defensively — mirrors the `room_player_*` event identity-check pattern at `useWsDispatch.ts:264,283,291,299`. Cross-scope improvement; touches all three scopes and both contract files. [client/src/shared/types/wsEvents.ts:266-273, server/internal/ws/events.go:128-135]
- **D91: Server accepts `RoomID = 0` on room-channel chat** — unlike the client (`ChatPanel.tsx` rejects non-positive integers), the Go handler only nil-checks `RoomID`. A request with `"roomId": 0` falls through to `RoomMembers(0)` which silently returns `(nil, false)` via the repo's not-found path. No exploit, but adds a pointless DB query on malformed input and diverges from client validation. Trivial fix: reject `*req.RoomID == 0` before the lookup. [server/internal/chat/handler.go:197-200]
- **D92: No client test for foreign-room isolation** — Spec AC "third player in a different room does not receive" is covered transitively by the server-side recipient filter (`TestHandler_RoomMessage_ExcludesNonMembers`). A dedicated client test would require either adding `roomId` to the payload (see D90) or a multi-room render harness. Tracked for after D90 lands so the discriminator exists to test against.
- **D93: No per-user rate limiting on chat sends** — all three scopes accept WS frames at ingress rate, so a compromised client can fan out two DB queries per frame on room chat (and broadcast storms on match/global). Matches Story 6.1 D72 / 6.2 D78 precedent: Phase 1 chat is intentionally unmoderated; revisit when chat moderation lands in Phase 2.

## Deferred from: counter-clockwise seat layout swap (2026-04-25)

- **D94: Story 4.3 spec contains inverted compass labels** — `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-3-game-table-ui-layout-seats-and-cards.md` line ~280 still describes turn order as "South→West→North→East, i.e., counter-clockwise around the table". After the layout correction, compass index 1 maps to East (right) and 3 maps to West (left), so the visual order is actually South→East→North→West — which is the geometrically correct counter-clockwise rotation when viewing the table from above. The spec doc's labels are stale; the code is now authoritative. Update doc when next touching Story 4.3.

## Deferred from: code review of dealer-indicator-and-trump-caller-name (2026-04-26)

- **D97: DealerIndicator stays visible behind/over `MatchResult`, `ReconnectOverlay`, and disconnected-phase overlays** — The dealer pill is gated only on a resolvable username (`gameState.players.find(p => p.seat === dealerSeat)?.username`), with no phase guard. During `match_end`, `disconnected`, or while a reconnect overlay is up, the badge can show through depending on each overlay's z-index. Spec explicitly says no upper bound on visibility, so this is by design today. Revisit if overlays should hide table chrome. [client/src/features/game/GamePage.tsx:376-396]
- **D98: No `truncate`/`max-width` clamp on dealer or trump-caller name spans** — Both `DealerIndicator` and the new caller-name span in `TrumpIndicator` render the username unclamped inside a flex pill anchored at `top-4 right-16`. A long username, RTL text, or emoji-heavy display name pushes the pill leftward into the seat/score area. No registration cap was checked in this story. Pick a UX-appropriate clamp (likely `max-w-[8rem] truncate` on the name spans plus `min-w-0` on the pill) when this lands. [client/src/features/game/components/DealerIndicator.tsx, client/src/features/game/components/TrumpIndicator.tsx]

## Deferred from: code review of bitola-deal-flip-bid-flow (2026-04-26)

- **D95: `reshuffleAndRedeal` does not reset `BelotAnnounced` / `DeclarationsResolved` / `PendingBelotSeat`** — Pre-existing behavior surfaced by the deal-flip-bid review. If the engine ever reaches `reshuffleAndRedeal` while these flags are set (today only reachable via the bidding-double-pass path, where they are zero by construction), they leak into the next bidding round. Not exploitable today because the only caller is `handlePassTrump` and bidding never sets those flags. Fix would zero them alongside the other reset block at `bidding.go:reshuffleAndRedeal`. Defensive cleanup; no current bug. [server/internal/game/bidding.go:130-160]
- **D96: `Deck` field is broadcast in every `event:game_state` frame, exposing the 11 undealt stage-2 cards** — Explicitly out of scope per the spec's `Never:` list, but the same systemic concern as opponent-hand exposure. A malicious client can read every stage-2 card before bidding ends, gaining a perfect-information advantage on whether to pick or pass. Fix requires either a per-seat broadcast DTO that strips hidden fields, or a `MarshalJSON` filter keyed off seat identity. Pairs with the latent hand-exposure issue across the WS protocol. [server/internal/game/state.go:70 + every `BroadcastToUsers` call]

## Deferred from: code review of bitola-round2-trump-prompt-shows-candidate (2026-04-26)

- **D97: Round-2 trump prompt can vertically overflow on short mobile viewports** — Surfaced when the candidate `PlayingCard` was added above the round-2 suit-selection grid. Total content (title + lg card + 4 suit buttons + PASS) can exceed ~360px viewport height on mobile landscape with no `max-h` or `overflow-y-auto` on the dialog body, leaving the PASS button unreachable. Pre-existing for round 1 (candidate + PICK + PASS) but worsened by round 2's denser stack. Fix would add `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` to the inner dialog or restructure the suit grid into a 2x2 layout for very-short viewports. Cosmetic; not a blocker for the desktop path. [client/src/features/game/components/TrumpPrompt.tsx:67-119]

## Deferred from: code review of 8-1-room-owner-pre-game-controls (2026-04-26)

- **D98: `kickedUsername` falls back to empty string on transient `FindPlayersByRoomID` error** — In `KickPlayer`, the pre-tx lookup `prePlayers, _ := h.repo.FindPlayersByRoomID(uint(roomID))` silently drops the error. On a transient repo failure, `kickedUsername` stays `""` and the `system:player_left` broadcast carries `username: ""`, rendering empty names in remaining clients' UI. Same pattern lives in the existing `LeaveRoom` handler — pre-existing convention, not regressed by this story. Fix would log the error and either fail-fast or capture the username from a different source. [server/internal/room/handler.go:766]
- **D99: `tx.FindPlayerRoom` is a global lookup, brittle to stale rows in other rooms** — `FindPlayerRoom(req.UserID)` returns the first room the user appears in across `waiting`/`playing` rooms. If a stale row exists in another room, `target.RoomID != uint(roomID)` produces `ErrNotInRoom` even though the player IS a member of the target room. A "is user X a member of room Y" query (e.g. `FindPlayerInRoom(roomID, userID)`) would be safer and reusable across `KickPlayer`, `LeaveRoom`, `SelectSeat`. Pre-existing repository surface; deferred. [server/internal/room/handler.go:793, server/internal/room/gorm_repo.go FindPlayerRoom]

## Deferred from: code review of 8-2-team-surrender (2026-04-27)

- **D100: Manager tests rely on `time.Sleep(30-100ms)` for async dispatch** — Six new surrender end-to-end tests use sleeps to wait for goroutine-driven broadcast. Flaky on loaded CI (Windows particularly). Pre-existing pattern in `manager_test.go`; the surrender additions inherit it. Replace with sync primitives (channels, `sync.WaitGroup`) or a poll-with-timeout helper across all session-manager async tests. [server/internal/session/manager_test.go]
- **D101: `event:match_end` broadcast precedes DB persistence in `handleMatchEnd`** — Surfaced by the surrender match-end review. Same race as the natural-end path: a client receiving `match_end` and immediately calling a hypothetical match-record API would see no row yet. Pre-existing; not surrender-specific. Fix would persist before broadcasting or move persistence into the same goroutine before `BroadcastToUsers`. [server/internal/session/manager.go:handleMatchEnd]
- **D102: `SurrenderPrompt` uses `absolute inset-0` instead of `fixed`** — Could leak through if the parent stacking context is wrong (scrolled/zoomed view). Mirrors `BelotPrompt` shape. Tests pass. Verify visual behavior on mobile and low-resolution viewports as part of UX polish; align with shadcn `Dialog` pattern used by `SurrenderButton` if needed. [client/src/features/game/components/SurrenderPrompt.tsx]
- **D103: `SurrenderPrompt` has no Escape-key dismissal (decline)** — Standard accessibility practice for modal dialogs is Escape == cancel. The `useFocusTrap` hook does not currently bind Escape; the shadcn `Dialog` used in `SurrenderButton` handles this automatically, leaving the two prompts inconsistent. Add Escape→onDecline either in the hook or in `SurrenderPrompt` directly. Affects `BelotPrompt` symmetrically. [client/src/features/game/components/SurrenderPrompt.tsx, client/src/shared/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts]
- **D104: `session.Manager` tests assert state-level rejection but not WS-level error broadcast** — Surrender rejection paths (non-partner accept, exhausted-after-decline, second-request-while-pending) currently verify `GetStateSnapshot` is unchanged; the spec's Task 8.2 listed the wire-level assertions on top (e.g. seat 1 receives `error:invalid_action`). The session manager takes a concrete `*ws.Hub`, so substituting a recorder requires either (a) an `interface Hub { SendToUser; BroadcastToUsers; ... }` refactor, or (b) wiring the `httptest.Server` + real WS-client pattern from `server/internal/ws/ws_test.go` into `session_test`. Either route is broader than this story. The apperr-level rejection codes are already covered by `surrender_test.go` (errors.Is matchers) and `sendGameError`'s switch table. Pick the cleanest path when the next session-manager test needs wire-level coverage. [server/internal/session/manager_test.go, server/internal/session/manager.go]

## Deferred from: center declaration dialog (2026-04-29)

- **D111: `spec-belot-rebelot-prompt-and-reveal.md` claims Belot's reveal "mirrors" the declaration reveal positioning** — After centering the declaration reveal, the two reveals diverge: declaration centers, Belot still anchors to the announcer's seat. The spec text (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-belot-rebelot-prompt-and-reveal.md:22`) is now stale documentation. Decide whether Belot should also center (separate request) or update the spec. Out of scope per the explicit request to center the declaration dialog only.
- **D112: `PauseOverlay` / `ReconnectOverlay` (z-20, full-viewport `bg-background/80`) silently cover the centered declaration reveal during a mid-reveal pause/disconnect** — Pre-existing behavior; the 8s timer keeps running and the reveal is consumed behind the tinted overlay. Centering the panel makes this slightly more noticeable than the seat-anchored variant because it now sits exactly under the overlay's visual focus. Fix would queue or pause the reveal timer when an overlay is active.

## Deferred from: code review of spec-team-us-them-and-cross-seat-layout (2026-05-02)

- **D113: `TeamStringForIndex` (Go) panics on input outside `{0, 1}`; TS `teamStringForIndex` callers collapse non-zero to `1`** — Both helpers assume a well-formed wire team index. Server-side panic in a session goroutine would crash the match. TS-side, every call site uses `(team === 0 ? 0 : 1)` which silently maps any future out-of-range value to teamB. Defensive hardening: Go variant returns `""` (or sentinel) instead of panic; TS variant accepts `number` and returns `null` for out-of-range; tighten Zod schemas to `z.union([z.literal(0), z.literal(1)])` so contract test rejects garbage at parse time. Pre-existing risk pattern, surfaced by the rename. [server/internal/game/state.go:130-145, client/src/shared/types/gameTypes.ts:45-47, client/src/features/game/components/{ScorePanel,ScoreReveal,MatchResult,DeclarationReveal,CapotAnimation}.tsx]
- **D114: `MatchResult` keeps physical column order (A on left, B on right) while flipping labels to Us/Them** — `ReconnectOverlay` and `MatchHistory` swap values to render viewer-first. Three components, three orderings. Pick one convention (likely viewer-always-first) and align. [client/src/features/game/components/MatchResult.tsx:30-31,73-92]
- **D115: `TrumpIndicator` displays neutral "Team A" / "Team B" while in-game** — Every other in-game display uses Us/Them; TrumpIndicator is the outlier. Add `viewerTeam` prop and key the team-name label off `team === viewerTeam ? t('team.us') : t('team.them')`. Or document why TrumpIndicator stays neutral. [client/src/features/game/components/TrumpIndicator.tsx:47-54]
- **D116: `OutcomeReason` Go field typed as raw `string`; Zod schema is `z.literal("surrender").optional()`** — Asymmetric strictness: TS rejects unknown values, Go accepts anything. If server emits a future `outcomeReason` value (e.g. `"timeout"`), strict Zod parse fails on the client. Fix would type `OutcomeReason` as a Go enum (`type OutcomeReason string` with constants). [server/internal/ws/events.go:121]
- **D117: Locale-overflow test (`RoomLobby.locale.test.tsx`) cannot fail in JSDOM** — `scrollWidth`/`clientWidth` always return 0; the comparison is trivially true. The accompanying `Tim A`/`Tim B` text-presence check covers i18n key mounting but not actual overflow. Wire the assertion into Playwright (or Vitest browser mode) to make AC-009 a real regression gate. [client/src/features/lobby/RoomLobby.locale.test.tsx]
- **D118: `events_contract_test.go` bootstraps missing goldens silently** — A contributor who deletes a golden gets a green test that blesses whatever the server emits at that moment. Make missing-golden a `t.Fatal` when running in CI mode (e.g. detect `os.Getenv("CI") != ""`) so only `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1` regenerates. [server/internal/ws/events_contract_test.go:264-272]
- **D119: `RoomLobby.diamond.test.tsx` accepts either east/west assignment via `[east, west].sort() === opponents`** — A refactor that swaps east and west would silently pass. Tighten to assert `east === (viewerSeat+1)%4` and `west === (viewerSeat+3)%4` directly. [client/src/features/lobby/RoomLobby.diamond.test.tsx:185-199]
- **D120: `DeclarationReveal.test.tsx` Us/Them assertions check `data-team` only, not visible text** — A future refactor that inverts the comparison would flip the rendered text but not the data attribute. Mock `useTranslation` and assert `toHaveTextContent("Us declared")` / `"Them declared"`. [client/src/features/game/components/DeclarationReveal.test.tsx:60-78]
- **D121: `showSelfLabel` timer cleanup on viewerSeat change leaves label briefly anchored to old position during owner-driven seat swap** — During an owner swap that moves the viewer between seats, the existing label (`isCurrentUser && cardinal === "south" && showSelfLabel`) stays visible at the old south-mapped tile until the new tile's effect fires. Reset `showSelfLabel` to false at the top of the effect when `viewerSeat` changes, then re-set after the timeout. [client/src/features/lobby/RoomLobby.tsx:188-204]
- **D122: `prefersReducedMotion` snapshotted via `useMemo([])` doesn't react to OS-level toggles** — Same shared pattern as D68. Refactor into a `useReducedMotion` hook that subscribes to `mql.addEventListener('change', ...)` and use across `RoomLobby`, `MatchResult`, `BelotReveal`, `DeclarationReveal`, `DealAnimation`. [client/src/features/lobby/RoomLobby.tsx:183-186]
- **D123: Empty `PlayerSeat` carries `data-team` attribute but uses neutral `border-border` instead of team color** — Pre-existing visual divergence from `RoomLobby` (which uses team-color border on empty seats). The `data-team` attribute is now rendered but unused for styling on the empty branch. Either apply team-color border or document the divergence. [client/src/features/game/components/PlayerSeat.tsx:33-43]
- **D124: Lockfile script self-exclusion is filename-based, brittle to rename or copy** — `--exclude="lockfile-old-team-tokens.sh"` matches basename. If the script is renamed or its regex copied to another file (doc, related script), that file fails CI by self-match. Replace with a marker line (e.g. `# LOCKFILE-PATTERN-EXEMPT`) and have the script skip files containing the marker. [scripts/lockfile-old-team-tokens.sh:70]
- **D125: Native-speaker review of Serbian "Tim A" / "Tim B" / "Mi" / "Oni"** — Native Belote players typically say "naša ekipa"/"njihova ekipa" or use color names colloquially. "Tim A" reads as a placeholder transliteration. Have a Serbian Belote player confirm the strings sound natural; substitute if not. [client/src/shared/i18n/sr.json:6-11]
- **D126: Go test assertion messages still mention "Red"/"Blue" as descriptive prose** — `scoring_test.go`, `fixtures.go` comments, `user/handler.go` comments use "Red team"/"Blue team" in English documentation. Doesn't trip the AC-001 regex (the regex targets identifiers, not prose). Cosmetic consistency cleanup; updates terminology for future readers. [server/internal/game/scoring_test.go, server/internal/game/testfixtures/fixtures.go]
- **D127: `viewerTeam` derivation in `GamePage.tsx` after `myPlayerSeat === null` early-return is fragile** — If `clearGame()` runs in the same React commit as a tail-of-match render, the JSX past the guard could read `myPlayerSeat` from a stale render. Speculative; no demonstrated regression. Snapshot via `useMemo([myPlayerSeat])` if the team-flip race ever surfaces. [client/src/features/game/GamePage.tsx:377]
- **D128: Unicode escapes `♠`/`♡`/`♢`/`♣` in `TrumpIndicator.tsx` changed to literal `♠♥♦♣`** — Drive-by edit during the rename pass. Functionally equivalent on a UTF-8 Vite project, but if the file was deliberately ASCII-escaped for tooling reasons, the diff silently regressed that. If literal codepoints are accepted as project convention, leave as-is; otherwise revert. [client/src/features/game/components/TrumpIndicator.tsx:11-16]

## Deferred from: code review of 8-3-in-game-emotes (2026-04-28)

- **D105: `lastEmoteAt` map grows unbounded for the lifetime of the process** — Per-user rate-limit map in `emote.Handler` is never pruned. One `time.Time` entry persists per unique user who has ever emoted; no eviction on session removal, no TTL sweep, no piggyback cleanup. Long-running server slowly accumulates one stale entry per lifetime user, not per active user. Fix would be either a periodic sweep of entries older than `rateLimitWindow` or a `RemoveUser(userID)` hook called from `session.Manager.RemoveSession`. [server/internal/emote/handler.go:40, :99-105]
- **D106: Cross-match rate-limit bleed-through silently drops first emote of new match** — Rate-limit state is keyed by userID with no session scoping. User emotes in match A at T=0, match A ends at T=1.5 s, user joins match B at T=2 s, tries to emote at T=2.5 s. Server's `acceptRateLimited` sees `2.5 - 0 = 2.5 s < 3 s` and silently drops with no echo, no error event, no UX feedback. Combine with D105 fix by clearing the user's entry when their session is removed. [server/internal/emote/handler.go:98-106]
- **D107: Picker `lastSentAt` resets when EmotePickerButton unmounts during phase transition** — Phase transitions (e.g. `playing` → `match_end` → next `dealing`) unmount and remount the picker via the parent's allowlist gate. The remounted picker has fresh `lastSentAt=0`, so tiles re-enable inside the 3 s window. The user clicks, sees no error, but the server silently drops the request via its authoritative rate-limit. UX disconnect with the server. Fix would lift `lastSentAt` to a `useRef` in GamePage or to the gameStore so it survives picker remounts. [client/src/features/game/components/EmotePickerButton.tsx:36, :92-100; client/src/features/game/GamePage.tsx:678-686]
- **D108: System clock backwards-jump (NTP step / laptop sleep) locks picker for arbitrary time** — `cooldownRemaining = COOLDOWN_MS - (Date.now() - lastSentAt)`; if the system clock jumps backward by N ms, `cooldownRemaining` becomes `3000 + N`. The `useEffect` schedules a `setTimeout(cooldownRemaining)` for that long. Picker tiles stay disabled for the full N+3 s. Fix would be `performance.now()` (monotonic) or `Math.min(cooldownRemaining, COOLDOWN_MS)`. [client/src/features/game/components/EmotePickerButton.tsx:43, :94-95]
- **D109: Stale `participants` slice broadcast after concurrent `session.Manager.RemoveSession`** — `MatchParticipantsByUser` takes RLock, captures `playerIDs`, releases. Concurrently `RemoveSession` (write lock) tears down the session. The emote handler then broadcasts to the now-orphaned IDs. `BroadcastToUsers` will deliver to any still-connected clients. The client-side `gameState === null` guard catches it only after `clearGame()` has run. Brief tail-of-match emote leak window. Fix would re-check session liveness inside the broadcast call or hold the lock through the broadcast. [server/internal/emote/handler.go:73-92; server/internal/session/manager.go:629-646]
- **D110: Stale `activeEmotes` slot survives match-end overlay then re-renders on overlay dismiss** — Bubble unmounts when `matchEndData !== null` gates kick in, without firing `onDismiss`, so the seat's slot stays non-null. The spec explicitly tolerates this ("the store still records the latest emote so that re-emergence renders the next live one"). However, a 30 s-old slot rendered for another 2 s after overlay dismissal looks like a stale replay. Path is unlikely (match-end → lobby triggers `clearGame()`), but a freshness check `Date.now() - slot.receivedAt < DURATION_MS` would prevent it. [client/src/shared/stores/gameStore.ts; client/src/features/game/GamePage.tsx:691-707]
