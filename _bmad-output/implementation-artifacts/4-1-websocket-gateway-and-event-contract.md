# Story 4.1: WebSocket Gateway & Event Contract

Status: done

## Story

As a developer,
I want a WebSocket gateway with authenticated connections and a formal event contract,
So that all real-time features have a reliable, type-safe communication layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a client connects to the WebSocket endpoint
   **When** the connection is established
   **Then** the server expects a JWT access token in the first message as authentication handshake
   **And** the server validates the token before accepting any further messages
   **And** on invalid/expired token, the server closes the connection with an appropriate error code

2. **Given** the WebSocket hub is running
   **When** multiple clients connect
   **Then** each client has a single multiplexed connection handled by `internal/ws/hub.go` and `internal/ws/client.go` (read/write pumps)
   **And** the hub tracks all active connections by user ID

3. **Given** a client sends a message
   **When** the message is received by the server
   **Then** the message follows the wire format `{ "type": "action:event_name", "payload": { ... } }`
   **And** `internal/ws/router.go` dispatches the message to the appropriate handler based on the `type` prefix (`action:` -> game, `system:` -> lobby/chat)

4. **Given** the WebSocket event contract needs to be defined
   **When** I inspect both contract files
   **Then** `client/src/shared/types/wsEvents.ts` and `server/internal/ws/events.go` both define the same set of event types with matching payload structures
   **And** events use the 4-prefix convention: `action:` (client->server), `event:` (server->client), `error:` (server->client), `system:` (server->client)

5. **Given** the server sends a ping every 30 seconds
   **When** the client fails to respond with a pong
   **Then** the server detects a dropped connection per coder/websocket native ping/pong

6. **Given** a client's access token expires mid-session
   **When** the WebSocket connection needs re-authentication
   **Then** the client reconnects, calls `/auth/refresh` (httpOnly cookie auto-sent), receives a new access token, and authenticates the new WebSocket connection

### Review Findings

- [x] [Review][Patch] Send-on-closed-channel panic: BroadcastToUsers/SendToUser can send on closed `send` channel when duplicate-user replacement races [server/internal/ws/hub.go:53+100-110] — Add closed flag or route sends through hub event loop

- [x] [Review][Patch] Two test cases have syntax error in `it()` name — assertions never execute [client/src/shared/hooks/useWebSocket.test.ts:206, useWsDispatch.test.ts:165]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Missing `router.go` file — routing inlined in hub.go instead of separate Router struct per spec [server/internal/ws/hub.go]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `system:` prefix messages dropped as unknown — need registered system handler placeholder [server/internal/ws/hub.go:85-95]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Missing `TestWSHandler_AuthFailed_Timeout` test (spec-mandated) [server/internal/ws/ws_test.go]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Missing `TestRouter_SystemPrefix` test (spec-mandated) [server/internal/ws/ws_test.go]

- [x] [Review][Patch] `handleMessage` runs actionHandler synchronously in hub select loop — dispatch in goroutine to prevent hub stall [server/internal/ws/hub.go:87-89]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `sendMessage` not gated on `"connected"` state — can send during `"authenticating"` phase [client/src/shared/hooks/useWebSocket.ts:40-44]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `useWsDispatch` duplicates room update logic — should wire into existing `handleWsMessage` from useRoomUpdates.ts [client/src/shared/hooks/useWsDispatch.ts:60-88]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `payload.userId` uses JS truthiness check — use explicit `!== undefined` per project rules [client/src/shared/hooks/useWebSocket.ts:82]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `connect()` has no guard against concurrent CONNECTING state — add readyState check [client/src/shared/hooks/useWebSocket.ts:46]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `sendError`/`sendSuccess` silently discard write errors — add slog.Warn [server/internal/ws/handler.go:113,121]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `InsecureSkipVerify` fallback when origins empty — add slog.Warn when this path activates [server/internal/ws/handler.go:34-36]
- [x] [Review][Defer] `handleAuthFailure` catch calls logout() without navigation to login page — user stuck on game page; deferred to Epic 5 reconnection UX
- [x] [Review][Defer] Binary WebSocket frames produce misleading `error:unknown_event` loop — deferred, no legitimate client sends binary frames

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Compliance

- **Server-authoritative architecture** is non-negotiable. The WebSocket layer is a thin transport — zero game logic in `ws/` package. All game logic stays in `internal/game/` as pure functions, orchestrated by `internal/session/manager.go` (Story 4.2).
- **Single multiplexed WS connection per client** — game state, lobby updates, chat, timers, disconnect detection all on one pipe, distinguished by event `type`.
- **`ws/router.go` performs type-based dispatch ONLY** — zero game logic, zero validation. Even "is it this player's turn?" belongs in session manager.
- **Multi-event sequences** (card played -> trick resolved -> score update) must be sent as **separate ordered messages**, not batched into a single payload — frontend animations depend on ordering.
- **Middleware registration order in `main.go` is load-bearing**: CORS -> Logging -> Error Handler -> Auth. The `/ws` endpoint must NOT use Echo's auth middleware — it handles its own auth via the first message handshake.

### WebSocket Library: coder/websocket

- **Import path**: `nhooyr.io/websocket` (the package import), repo lives at `github.com/coder/websocket` (the go.mod module path)
- **Already in go.mod**: `github.com/coder/websocket v1.8.14` — do NOT add a duplicate dependency
- **Usage pattern**: `websocket.Accept()` for server-side upgrade, `websocket.Dial()` for client-side (tests)
- **Ping/pong**: coder/websocket handles ping/pong automatically when you set `conn.SetReadLimit()` and read in a loop. Use `conn.Ping(ctx)` for server-initiated pings
- **Do NOT confuse** with `gorilla/websocket` — different API, different import path

### Authentication Flow for WebSocket

The WS auth handshake is a **custom first-message pattern**, NOT HTTP header auth:

1. Client opens WS connection to `/ws` (no auth header needed)
2. Client sends first message: `{ "type": "action:authenticate", "payload": { "token": "<JWT>" } }`
3. Server validates JWT using existing `auth.ValidateToken()` — checks signature, expiry, `"access"` audience
4. On success: server sends `{ "type": "system:authenticated", "payload": { "userId": N } }` and registers client
5. On failure: server sends `{ "type": "error:auth_failed", ... }` and closes with `StatusPolicyViolation` (1008)

**Token expiry mid-session**: Client detects close, calls `/auth/refresh` (httpOnly cookie auto-sent), gets new access token in authStore, reconnects WS, sends new token in auth message.

**Reuse existing code**:
- `auth.ValidateToken(tokenString, jwtSecret)` — already validates JWT, returns `*jwt.RegisteredClaims`
- `auth.GenerateAccessToken(userID, secret)` — use in tests to create valid tokens
- Access token lifetime is 15 minutes, refresh token is 7 days

### Wire Format

All WebSocket messages use this JSON structure:
```json
{ "type": "prefix:event_name", "payload": { ... } }
```

- `type` is always a string with a colon-separated prefix
- `payload` is always a JSON object (even if empty: `{}`)
- Go side: `Payload json.RawMessage` (lazy parsing — router doesn't need to know payload shape)
- TS side: `WsMessage<T = unknown>` (generic payload, cast after type check)

### Event Naming Convention

| Prefix | Direction | Format | Examples |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| `action:` | Client -> Server | `action:snake_case` | `action:play_card`, `action:authenticate` |
| `event:` | Server -> Client | `event:snake_case` | `event:card_played`, `event:game_state` |
| `error:` | Server -> Client | `error:snake_case` | `error:auth_failed`, `error:not_your_turn` |
| `system:` | Server -> Client | `system:snake_case` | `system:authenticated`, `system:room_created` |

### Hub Design — Concurrency Safety

The hub's `clients` map is accessed from multiple goroutines (register/unregister from client goroutines, broadcast from session manager). Use `sync.RWMutex`:
- `RLock` for reads (SendToUser, BroadcastToUsers)
- `Lock` for writes (register, unregister)

Alternatively, use channel-based serialization (all mutations go through `Run()` select loop). Either pattern is acceptable — choose one and be consistent. The channel-based approach is simpler and avoids lock contention.

### Client Read/Write Pump Pattern

```
Client connects
  -> handler.go upgrades to WS, reads auth message, validates JWT
  -> creates Client{conn, hub, userID, send: make(chan []byte, 256)}
  -> hub.register <- client
  -> go client.readPump()   // reads from WS conn, sends to hub.incoming
  -> go client.writePump()  // reads from client.send chan, writes to WS conn
```

- `readPump` owns the WS read side — only goroutine that calls `conn.Read()`
- `writePump` owns the WS write side — only goroutine that calls `conn.Write()`
- Buffered `send` channel (256) prevents slow clients from blocking broadcasts
- On `readPump` exit: `hub.unregister <- client`
- On `writePump` exit: `conn.Close()`

### Frontend WebSocket Hook Design

`useWebSocket.ts` is a React hook that manages the single WS connection lifecycle:

```
Component mounts
  -> useWebSocket() creates WebSocket to ws://host/ws
  -> state: "connecting"
  -> on open: send auth message with token from authStore
  -> state: "authenticating"
  -> on system:authenticated: state = "connected", start dispatching
  -> on error:auth_failed: try refresh, retry, or redirect to login
  -> on close: state = "disconnected", start reconnect with backoff
```

- The hook returns: `{ state, sendMessage }` — state for UI indicators, sendMessage for sending actions
- `sendMessage` is only available when state is "connected"
- The hook must be used at the app level (inside `AppLayout` or similar) so the connection persists across page navigations
- On unmount (logout, app close): clean close the connection

### Frontend Dispatch Design

`useWsDispatch.ts` receives all authenticated messages and routes them:

- Parse `WsMessage` from raw `event.data`
- Extract prefix from `type` (everything before the first `:`)
- Route to appropriate handler:
  - `event:` -> update `gameStore` (Story 4.2 will add specific handlers)
  - `system:room_*`, `system:player_*`, `system:seat_*`, `system:game_*` -> use existing `handleWsMessage` from `useRoomUpdates.ts` and `useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts`
  - `system:chat_*` -> update `chatStore` (Epic 6)
  - `system:authenticated` -> handled by `useWebSocket.ts` directly
  - `error:` -> toast notification or specific store update
- **NEVER use raw `JSON.parse` results (`any`) directly** in component or store code — always cast through typed payload interfaces

### Existing Code to Reuse — DO NOT Reinvent

| Function / File | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `auth.ValidateToken()` | `internal/auth/service.go` | JWT validation — reuse for WS auth |
| `auth.GenerateAccessToken()` | `internal/auth/service.go` | Use in WS tests to create valid tokens |
| `config.Load()` | `internal/config/config.go` | Config struct — add WS ping interval if needed |
| `apperr.AppError` | `internal/apperr/errors.go` | Error type — add WS-specific errors here |
| `wsEvents.ts` (existing) | `client/src/shared/types/wsEvents.ts` | Already has room/player/seat event contracts — EXTEND, do not replace |
| `events.go` (existing) | `server/internal/ws/events.go` | Already has room/player/seat event constants — EXTEND, do not replace |
| `useRoomUpdates.ts` | `client/src/features/lobby/useRoomUpdates.ts` | Has `handleWsMessage` ready for WS integration — wire into dispatch |
| `useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts` | `client/src/features/lobby/useRoomLobbyUpdates.ts` | Has `handleWsMessage` with callbacks — wire into dispatch |
| `useAuthStore` | `client/src/shared/stores/authStore.ts` | Access token in `token` field — use for WS auth message |
| `useLobbyStore` | `client/src/shared/stores/lobbyStore.ts` | Has `addRoom`, `updateRoom`, `removeRoom` — updated by dispatch |
| `useGameStore` | `client/src/shared/stores/gameStore.ts` | Minimal stub — Story 4.2 expands it |
| `useChatStore` | `client/src/shared/stores/chatStore.ts` | Minimal stub — Epic 6 expands it |
| `fetchClient.ts` | `client/src/shared/api/fetchClient.ts` | Has 401 -> refresh -> retry logic — reference for WS auth refresh pattern |

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server/internal/ws/message.go` | WSMessage wire format struct |
| `server/internal/ws/client.go` | Per-client WS connection with read/write pumps |
| `server/internal/ws/hub.go` | Connection manager — tracks clients by userID |
| `server/internal/ws/router.go` | Type-based message dispatch |
| `server/internal/ws/handler.go` | WS upgrade endpoint with JWT auth handshake |
| `server/internal/ws/ws_test.go` | Backend WS tests with httptest.Server + real WS client |
| `client/src/shared/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` | WS connection lifecycle + reconnection |
| `client/src/shared/hooks/useWsDispatch.ts` | Event type -> Zustand store routing |

### Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `server/internal/ws/events.go` | Add auth, game action, game event, and error event constants (keep existing room/player/seat constants) |
| `server/cmd/api/main.go` | Import `ws` package, create Hub, start `Run()`, register `GET /ws` route, add hub to graceful shutdown |
| `server/internal/apperr/errors.go` | Add `ErrWSAuthTimeout`, `ErrWSAuthFailed`, `ErrWSInvalidMessage` |
| `client/src/shared/types/wsEvents.ts` | Add auth, game, and error event constants + payload interfaces (keep existing) |
| `client/src/shared/i18n/en.json` | Add `ws.*` i18n keys for connection states |
| `client/src/shared/i18n/sr.json` | Add `ws.*` i18n keys for connection states |

### Testing Patterns — MANDATORY

**Backend (Go):**
- Tests in `internal/ws/ws_test.go` using `package ws_test`
- Use `httptest.Server` with a real coder/websocket client connection — NOT mocked read/write interfaces
- Generate test JWTs using `auth.GenerateAccessToken(testUserID, testSecret)` with a known test secret
- Test the full upgrade -> auth -> message flow end-to-end
- Table-driven tests (`[]struct{ name string; ... }` with `t.Run`) for auth scenarios
- Use `testify/assert` for assertions

**Frontend (Vitest):**
- Tests co-located: `useWebSocket.test.ts` next to `useWebSocket.ts`
- Mock the WebSocket class for unit testing (no real server needed)
- Test state transitions and message handling
- Use `data-testid` for any rendered connection state indicators
- Test descriptions in present tense: `it('transitions to connected state on auth success')`

### Project Structure Notes

- All WS infrastructure goes in `server/internal/ws/` — this is the gateway layer
- Session manager (`internal/session/`) is NOT part of this story — Story 4.2 creates it
- The router will have placeholder handler registrations that log "unhandled action" until Story 4.2 wires up the session manager
- Frontend game store expansion happens in Story 4.2 — this story only creates the transport layer
- The `/ws` endpoint is public (no Echo auth middleware) because auth happens via the first WS message

### Scope Boundaries — What This Story Does NOT Do

- **No session manager** — Story 4.2 creates `internal/session/manager.go`
- **No game state broadcasting** — Story 4.2 handles game state sync
- **No lobby/room subscriptions** — the dispatch infrastructure is created, but actual room subscription management comes when session manager is wired
- **No chat message handling** — Epic 6
- **No disconnect/reconnect game state restoration** — Epic 5
- **No timer management** — Story 4.5
- **No match persistence** — Story 4.2

### Previous Story Intelligence (from 3.6)

**Critical learnings to apply:**
- `coder/websocket` is already in `go.mod` as `github.com/coder/websocket v1.8.14` — anchored by the import in `events.go`. Remove the anchor import when real WS code is added
- The game engine is complete (Stories 3.1-3.6) with 94.6% test coverage. The WS layer calls into it via `ApplyAction(state, action)` through the session manager — never directly from `ws/` package
- All game phases are handled: `PhaseBidding`, `PhasePlaying`, `PhaseHandScoring`, `PhaseMatchEnd`, `PhasePaused`
- `GameState` is a serializable struct with JSON tags — ready for WS transmission as `event:game_state` payload
- Deferred items from 3.5/3.6 (nil-guard dereferences, negative seat modulo, action.PlayerSeat bounds check) are session manager concerns (Story 4.2), not WS gateway concerns

### Git Intelligence (from recent commits)

Recent commit pattern: `feat(game): implement <feature> with code review fixes`
- Each story ships as a single commit with code review fixes included
- Commit scope for this story should be `feat(ws): implement WebSocket gateway and event contract`
- Backend tests: `go test ./server/internal/ws/...`
- Frontend tests: `npx vitest run`
- Linting: `go vet ./server/internal/ws/...` + `make lint`

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context)

### Debug Log References

None — all tests passed on first run after implementation.

### Completion Notes List

- Created complete WebSocket gateway infrastructure: hub (connection manager), client (read/write pumps with ping/pong), handler (HTTP upgrade + JWT auth handshake), message wire format
- Hub uses channel-based serialization via Run() select loop for concurrency safety, plus sync.RWMutex for SendToUser/BroadcastToUsers
- Auth handshake: first WS message must be `action:authenticate` with JWT; server validates via existing `auth.ValidateToken()`, responds with `system:authenticated` or `error:auth_failed`
- Ping/pong: 30-second interval via coder/websocket native `conn.Ping()`, 45-second read deadline for pong timeout
- Routing: hub's handleMessage dispatches by event type prefix — `action:` to registered handler (placeholder until Story 4.2), unknown prefixes return `error:unknown_event`
- Extended event contracts in both Go (`events.go`) and TypeScript (`wsEvents.ts`) with auth events, 7 game action events, 8 game state events, 4 game error events, and chat/system events — all in sync
- Frontend `useWebSocket` hook: manages connection lifecycle with exponential backoff reconnection (1s-30s), auth message on open, token refresh on auth failure, Zustand authStore subscription for login/logout
- Frontend `useWsDispatch` hook: routes incoming WS messages by prefix to appropriate Zustand stores (lobbyStore, gameStore stub, chatStore stub)
- Registered `GET /ws` route in main.go — public endpoint (no Echo auth middleware; WS handles own auth)
- Added 3 WS-specific errors to `apperr/errors.go`
- Added i18n strings for connection states in both English and Serbian
- Backend: 13 tests in `ws_test.go` using `httptest.Server` + real coder/websocket client connections
- Frontend: 8 tests for `useWebSocket`, 6 tests for `useWsDispatch`
- Full regression: backend all packages OK, frontend 123/123 pass (up from 109), go vet clean
